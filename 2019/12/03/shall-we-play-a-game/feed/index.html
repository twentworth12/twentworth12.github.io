					<description><![CDATA[Oh my, this brings back memories, although mine was learning BASIC on an Atari-400. There was nothing like the thrill of running my first program and getting a fireworks display! I wasn&#039;t deep into BBSes but my computer geek friend was and he was able to get me some great WareZ for my Atari-800 (I came up in the world!)

I was the only girl learning FORTRAN and PASCAL in High School and to this day I know how to score bowling games from the program I had to write to do it. I even did better than my computer geek friend on the AP test but, sigh, I wish I had not convinced myself in college that I had to choose between writing and programming. I don&#039;t necessarily regret going in a communications direction, but I wish I&#039;d been able to integrate my passion for technology with my affinity for writing earlier in my career. 

Good luck at Recorded Future! It&#039;s becoming increasingly more evident how important it is to be proactive with cybersecurity. I feel like most of the companies I&#039;ve worked for are ripe fruit for the Lightmans of the world.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Really well written Tom! The move makes complete sense for you - not only from a career standpoint, but also given the background story you told here. Recorded Future is in great hands and should be happy to have you :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You did a lot of the things I did to get started in computer programming.  For me, it was the Radio Shack TRS-80 computers that I learned on.  I just wish that U of I had music as a possible major with computer science back then, because I could already play piano, and I wouldn&#039;t have had to struggle with math or statistics.]]></description>
