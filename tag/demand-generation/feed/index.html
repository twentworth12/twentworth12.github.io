										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently came across a <a href="https://mattermark.com/effective-lead-scoring-includes-company-data/?utm_campaign=Sales%20Insights&amp;utm_content=40409664&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter" data-href="https://mattermark.com/effective-lead-scoring-includes-company-data/?utm_campaign=Sales%20Insights&amp;utm_content=40409664&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-mce-href="https://mattermark.com/effective-lead-scoring-includes-company-data/?utm_campaign=Sales%20Insights&amp;utm_content=40409664&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">lead scoring</a> article on the <a href="https://medium.com/u/40233f4ee393" data-href="https://medium.com/u/40233f4ee393" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="40233f4ee393" data-action-value="40233f4ee393" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-mce-href="https://medium.com/u/40233f4ee393">Mattermark</a> blog that reminded me of a post I’ve been wanting to write for a while: <strong>the way nearly everyone is doing lead scoring is totally wrong.</strong></p>
<p>In the modern era of data-driven marketing where marketers boast about being able to connect every penny of marketing spend to revenue, we are using nothing more than gut instinct and anecodotal feedback to figure out the best leads to pass to sales. The main culprit for this data-driven nightmare is the way lead scoring is implemented in marketing automation systems like Marketo and Pardot.</p>
<p>For example, here’s how lead scoring currently works in Pardot: at the system level, you can assign points to specific actions like email opens, page views, form submissions etc.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" data-image-id="1*O8PwWGU-WexnXBF6i65OQg.png" data-width="1063" data-height="235" src="https://i0.wp.com/tomwentworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/0a6c6-1O8PwWGU-WexnXBF6i65OQg.png?ssl=1" data-mce-src="https://i0.wp.com/tomwentworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/0a6c6-1O8PwWGU-WexnXBF6i65OQg.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
<p>You can also add points as a completion action to things like form submissions to weigh specific types of actions and content more heavily than others; like maybe an analyst report or a specific webinar.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" data-image-id="1*SBSgbeFp6jcruCVDCjNWBQ.png" data-width="1002" data-height="235" src="https://i0.wp.com/tomwentworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/c2160-1SBSgbeFp6jcruCVDCjNWBQ.png?ssl=1" data-mce-src="https://i0.wp.com/tomwentworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/c2160-1SBSgbeFp6jcruCVDCjNWBQ.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
<p>The idea of course is that now we can pass the highest scored leads to sales, and that there is a correlation between the lead score and likelihood to buy.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" data-image-id="1*NN2lYTeWGf0wPKtHLRfE3g.png" data-width="903" data-height="308" src="https://i0.wp.com/tomwentworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/98d2d-1NN2lYTeWGf0wPKtHLRfE3g.png?ssl=1" data-mce-src="https://i0.wp.com/tomwentworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/98d2d-1NN2lYTeWGf0wPKtHLRfE3g.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
<p>But as <a href="https://medium.com/u/460e82ba46e" data-href="https://medium.com/u/460e82ba46e" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="460e82ba46e" data-action-value="460e82ba46e" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-mce-href="https://medium.com/u/460e82ba46e">Mike Volpe</a> points out the way we assign “points” makes absolutely no sense, yet somehow it has become accepted as the gospel of modern lead management best practices.</p>
<div class="embed-twitter">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have been on a 5 year rampage against the &quot;we give 10 points for VP title&quot; method of lead scoring. Why not 11 or 9 pts?</p>
<p>&mdash; Mike Volpe (@mvolpe) <a href="https://twitter.com/mvolpe/status/786317672237535233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>It turns out that accumulating points is actually a terrible way of predicting an outcome, leading to marketing passing horrible leads to sales; like the serial webinar attenders (you know, those people that come to <strong>EVERY SINGLE WEBINAR</strong> you run) and habitual email openers— instead of the people most likely to actually buy your product.</p>
<p>It’s likely that much of the benefit of manual lead scoring comes from the placebo effect of telling sales that you are only passing them the best leads. So in turn they work them more exhausitively, and you’ll get better results than the unscored leads of the past that sales would mostly ignore. But that doesn’t mean they are better quality leads. They could actually be <strong>worse</strong> and you’d never know it.</p>
<p>Don’t believe me? Here’s an A|B experiment you should run immediately:</p>
<p>Take 10–25% of your lower scored leads using your current lead scoring model and start passing them to sales. The leads should appear like the rest of the higher scored leads(MQLs) you are currently passing to sales, and don’t tell anyone so there is no bias on how the leads are worked. Make sure you can identify leads in the experiment group against the control group.</p>
<p>Run the test for as <a href="https://vwo.com/ab-split-test-significance-calculator/" data-href="https://vwo.com/ab-split-test-significance-calculator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-mce-href="https://vwo.com/ab-split-test-significance-calculator/">long as it takes for your test to hit statistical significance</a>, which will be based on how many of your leads convert into whatever metric you are using to gauge the health of leads e.g. SAL, SQL, etc.</p>
<p>In a few weeks after your sales team finishes following up on the batch of leads, compare the two groups using whatever conversion metric you are using. Now did the higher scored leads convert better than the lower scored leads? When I ran this experiment at my last company they didn’t — and the lower scored leads converted at a slightly better rate than the higher scored leads. Oops.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Building a lead scoring model by assigning random points to actions and attributes of leads is just about as un-data driven as it gets.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The solution is to build a lead scoring model based on a proven mathemetical model that will really tell you the features — or attributes of a lead — that have a statistically significant corrleation with the outcome you are trying to predict e.g. people who buy your product. Unlike the randomness of assigning points to specific behaviors and attributes of a lead, a predictive model will give you a statistical measure of which features actually matter the most.</p>
<p>There are predictive marketing products that will do this for you — like Infer, Mintigo, and Everstring. But they come with a hefty price and are overkill for many companies. You can get started for free using tools like <a href="http://rapidminer.com" data-href="http://rapidminer.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-mce-href="http://rapidminer.com">RapidMiner Studio</a> or even good old Microsoft Excel.</p>
<p>The first problem you’ll need to tackle is getting access to clean data. Predictive lead scoring is mostly a “wide data” problem; you want as much data as possible about your users to uncover the specific features that have the most impact on closing deals. This means combining data from your CRM and marketing automation system, hopefully your product, and perhaps even external APIs. But chances are the data from your CRM and marketing automation system is clean enough to get started.</p>
<p>Once you have the data, you’ll model it using a variety of machine learning techniques, and most likely you’ll start with some form of regression. I won’t attempt to explain the math behind regression here, but if you are interested here’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X4eLvPSLQk" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X4eLvPSLQk" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-mce-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X4eLvPSLQk">good overview from RapidMiner founder Dr. Ingo Mierswa</a>.</p>
<p>Here are two resources for getting started with either Excel or RapidMiner Studio for free:</p>
<ol>
<li>This <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/MikeVolpe/lead-scoring-how-a-stanford-engineer-and-mit-mba-approaches-it-ilya-mirman-onshape-growth-camp-june-2016" data-href="http://www.slideshare.net/MikeVolpe/lead-scoring-how-a-stanford-engineer-and-mit-mba-approaches-it-ilya-mirman-onshape-growth-camp-june-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-mce-href="http://www.slideshare.net/MikeVolpe/lead-scoring-how-a-stanford-engineer-and-mit-mba-approaches-it-ilya-mirman-onshape-growth-camp-june-2016">video from Ilya Mirman</a>, the VP of Marketing at OnShape, shows you how to build a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/MikeVolpe/lead-scoring-how-a-stanford-engineer-and-mit-mba-approaches-it-ilya-mirman-onshape-growth-camp-june-2016" data-href="http://www.slideshare.net/MikeVolpe/lead-scoring-how-a-stanford-engineer-and-mit-mba-approaches-it-ilya-mirman-onshape-growth-camp-june-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-mce-href="http://www.slideshare.net/MikeVolpe/lead-scoring-how-a-stanford-engineer-and-mit-mba-approaches-it-ilya-mirman-onshape-growth-camp-june-2016">predictive lead scoring model in Excel</a> using linear regression. Okay fine, Ilya is a Stanford-educated engineer and MIT MBA, but the approach he outlines is something even mere mortal Excel power users could figure out with a little bit of effort. If you can do a VLOOKUP, you can try this.</li>
<li>With a bit more effort you could <a href="https://my.rapidminer.com/nexus/account/index.html#downloads" data-href="https://my.rapidminer.com/nexus/account/index.html#downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-mce-href="https://my.rapidminer.com/nexus/account/index.html#downloads">download RapidMiner Studio</a>, which will help you both prepare your data and build your predictive model. RapidMiner Studio provides far more options for modeling than Excel, and will help you get a more accurate predictive model. The current lead scoring model we’re using at RapidMiner was built by my colleague <a href="https://medium.com/u/f35d4f3f924f" data-href="https://medium.com/u/f35d4f3f924f" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="f35d4f3f924f" data-action-value="f35d4f3f924f" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-mce-href="https://medium.com/u/f35d4f3f924f">Thomas Ott</a>, and here’s a webinar where he walks through how we built the model complete with <a href="https://rapidminer.com/resource/using-data-science-identify-qualified-leads/" data-href="https://rapidminer.com/resource/using-data-science-identify-qualified-leads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-mce-href="https://rapidminer.com/resource/using-data-science-identify-qualified-leads/">a sample of our data and the model we use today</a>.</li>

<p>Regardless of which tool you use, you’ll get a result that looks something like this — a weighted view of the lead attributes that actually result in more deals.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" data-image-id="1*uasmAtk_hqRLIigehnUvBw.png" data-width="1028" data-height="738" src="https://i0.wp.com/tomwentworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/78add-1uasmAtk_hqRLIigehnUvBw.png?ssl=1" data-mce-src="https://i0.wp.com/tomwentworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/78add-1uasmAtk_hqRLIigehnUvBw.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
<p>For example, in our RapidMiner lead scoring model. the number of product starts was the most important factor in predicting a purchase, and leads from Netherlands were more likely to close than any other country.</p>
<p>We used <a href="https://rapidminer.com/products/server/" data-href="https://rapidminer.com/products/server/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-mce-href="https://rapidminer.com/products/server/">RapidMiner Server </a>to automate adding our predictive lead score to Salesforce, but even a simple Excel output of your weighted attributes is enough for you to make those marketing automation point assignments using mathetically-sound principals instead of educated guesses. And that’s a huge step in the right direction, and you didn’t even have to spend a bunch of money on a predictive lead scoring product to make it happen.</p>
<p>Lastly, I highly recommend everyone read <a href="https://medium.com/u/deeb5accef0a" data-href="https://medium.com/u/deeb5accef0a" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="deeb5accef0a" data-action-value="deeb5accef0a" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-mce-href="https://medium.com/u/deeb5accef0a">Myk Pono</a>’s opus on <a href="https://medium.com/startup-grind/how-to-design-lead-nurturing-lead-scoring-and-drip-email-campaigns-9961024f6605#.7voau6lda" data-href="https://medium.com/startup-grind/how-to-design-lead-nurturing-lead-scoring-and-drip-email-campaigns-9961024f6605#.7voau6lda" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-mce-href="https://medium.com/startup-grind/how-to-design-lead-nurturing-lead-scoring-and-drip-email-campaigns-9961024f6605#.7voau6lda">How To Design Lead Nurturing, Lead Scoring, and Drip Email Campaigns</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Few things cause CMOs to panic more than hearing the dreaded phrase “we need to widen the lead funnel” from the head of sales. Or the CEO. Or maybe even the board. What they all really want is more qualified opportunities and ultimately more ARR. Maybe that means widening the funnel. Maybe not. But the solution is much more complex than just delivering “more”. Let’s dig into what can go wrong when you try to widen the funnel.</p>
<p>Every CMO has a version of this spreadsheet, that starts with an ARR target and spits out a lead, marketing-qualified lead (MQL), and sales-qualified opportunity (SQO) goal using historical funnel conversion metrics. Here’s a simple example using made-up numbers:</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" data-image-id="1*VWIavrCiNinSFGY-JQsY4g.png" data-width="519" data-height="228" src="https://i0.wp.com/tomwentworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/fe0c0-1VWIavrCiNinSFGY-JQsY4g.png?ssl=1" data-mce-src="https://i0.wp.com/tomwentworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/fe0c0-1VWIavrCiNinSFGY-JQsY4g.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
<p>In this case, I’ve taken the next quarters ARR goal of $5,000,000, assumed 75% of it comes from marketing, and that we’ll close 33% of the opportunites we create at an average deal size of $25,000. Based on these assumptions, my model spits out a lead target of 5051 and an MQL target of 1515.</p>
<p>When the next quarter comes along, we do the same exercise. Let’s say we’re shooting for 40% ARR growth, which means we need 40% more leads + MQLs.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" data-image-id="1*a3mk8SseIyV6qjcOFTwu7g.png" data-width="517" data-height="223" src="https://i0.wp.com/tomwentworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3a2ba-1a3mk8SseIyV6qjcOFTwu7g.png?ssl=1" data-mce-src="https://i0.wp.com/tomwentworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/3a2ba-1a3mk8SseIyV6qjcOFTwu7g.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
<p>Here’s where the problems start happening.</p>
<p>In the early days of a company most MQLs come through inbound sources, but as the MQL target gets higher CMOs feel pressured to try new tactics to hit the goal. At that often means scaling paid programs that guarantee a certain number of leads based on targeted criteria like company size, role, industry etc. The targeted criteria helps ensure these leads become MQLs as they map to the attributes in your lead scoring process.</p>
<p>But not all MQLs are created equal. For example, your lead scoring processes probably overweight fit (think job title, industry, company size, etc) and underweight behavior/interest. So while those new paid leads look great in the spreadsheet you received from the vendor, they aren’t going to convert at the same rate as your primarily inbound funnel did in the past. So inside sales converts less of them into opportunities, and as a result probably loosens their qualification criteria to hit their numbers. Here’s how the funnel math looks now with the less qualified MQLs added in, impacting conversion:</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" data-image-id="1*I43g4xc2DAsX-ILjzbhkXw.png" data-width="453" data-height="227" src="https://i0.wp.com/tomwentworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/de082-1I43g4xc2DAsX-ILjzbhkXw.png?ssl=1" data-mce-src="https://i0.wp.com/tomwentworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/de082-1I43g4xc2DAsX-ILjzbhkXw.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
<p>When we lower the SQO conversion rate and the win rate just a little bit, the MQL target starts to spiral out of control. Because we’re not as efficient, our MQL target is now 85% higher than the previous quarter. If we play it out one final quarter, assuming we continue to get slightly less efficient, here’s what the targets looks like:</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" data-image-id="1*eXPPvZBa8IQaNUiMSOggsg.png" data-width="509" data-height="220" src="https://i0.wp.com/tomwentworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/d8619-1eXPPvZBa8IQaNUiMSOggsg.png?ssl=1" data-mce-src="https://i0.wp.com/tomwentworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/d8619-1eXPPvZBa8IQaNUiMSOggsg.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
<p>In this made up example, over four quarters our ARR target increased by 173% while our MQL target went up by 307%! And we had to pay for all those MQLs — and hire inside sales capacity to process them — driving our CAC way up. Of course I’m making a bunch of assumptions here that won’t hold true for everyone, but the point is that scaling the top of the funnel alone won’t lead to growth nirvana, and could be the entirely wrong thing to do.</p>
<p>Some companies like HubSpot rely entirely on widening the funnel to grow. This makes sense, as they sell in the massive SMB market and get most of their leads through low-cost inbound sources. But if your company sells into larger enterprises, has a vertical go-to-market, targets a niche persona, etc. you should be more focused on acquiring, converting, and closing the right leads, which might be measured only in tens or hundreds depending on your market.</p>
<p>Instead of just arbitrarily widening the funnel, what happens if we focus on scaling higher converting lead sources and targeting the right buyers? Magic. We generate higher quality leads, convert more of them, and win bigger deals. Much more efficiently. Going back to our prior example, hitting our Q2 target now only requires 84% more leads vs. 307% in the inefficent model.</p>

<p>If this sounds like I’m <a href="http://www.insightsquared.com/2016/02/sales-vps-abm/" data-href="http://www.insightsquared.com/2016/02/sales-vps-abm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-mce-href="http://www.insightsquared.com/2016/02/sales-vps-abm/">advocating for account-based marketing</a>, you’re absolutely right. ABM is a great way to reach the prospects who are most likely to buy from you, improving funnel metrics. I also <a href="http://digitalmarketing.captora.com/rs/719-TVA-959/images/Acquia%20Case%20Study.pdf" data-href="http://digitalmarketing.captora.com/rs/719-TVA-959/images/Acquia%20Case%20Study.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-mce-href="http://digitalmarketing.captora.com/rs/719-TVA-959/images/Acquia%20Case%20Study.pdf">recommend products like Captora</a> that help you grow the top of the funnel by scaling higher converting channels like organic search.</p>
<p>The net is that more isn’t always better. Often narrowing the top of the funnel is exactly what it takes to widen what really matters — the “Closed Won” funnel stage.</p>
