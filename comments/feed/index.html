					<description><![CDATA[Oh my, this brings back memories, although mine was learning BASIC on an Atari-400. There was nothing like the thrill of running my first program and getting a fireworks display! I wasn&#039;t deep into BBSes but my computer geek friend was and he was able to get me some great WareZ for my Atari-800 (I came up in the world!)

I was the only girl learning FORTRAN and PASCAL in High School and to this day I know how to score bowling games from the program I had to write to do it. I even did better than my computer geek friend on the AP test but, sigh, I wish I had not convinced myself in college that I had to choose between writing and programming. I don&#039;t necessarily regret going in a communications direction, but I wish I&#039;d been able to integrate my passion for technology with my affinity for writing earlier in my career. 

Good luck at Recorded Future! It&#039;s becoming increasingly more evident how important it is to be proactive with cybersecurity. I feel like most of the companies I&#039;ve worked for are ripe fruit for the Lightmans of the world.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You did a lot of the things I did to get started in computer programming.  For me, it was the Radio Shack TRS-80 computers that I learned on.

					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] By the time Wargames came out, I was already well into my obsession with computers and programming BASIC on my trusty TI-99 4/A. But Wargames threw my obsession into overdrive. I figured out how to lock down my computer with a password (Joshua obv) to prevent unauthorized access my from snooping parents. I got a 300 baud modem for my birthday, fast enough to read scroll text in real time from remote systems. I discovered the magic of the BBS where I could play games, chat with other nerds, and yes, download WaReZ (look, I was 11). It was absolutely magical. I kept programming all the way through high school and went to the University of Illinois to study math and computer science. At Illinois, I worked as a UNIX admin responsible for maintaining DNS. I read the 1992 first edition of O&#8217;Reilly DNS and BIND cover to cover. Eventually I realized at age 22 that I wasn&#8217;t very good at programming and that it was time to find something else to do. [&#8230;]]]></description>
