<p>TL;DR: In this post, I reviewed five fascinating books that I read while recently on vacation: &#8220;Becoming Steve Jobs,&#8221; an in-depth biography exploring Jobs&#8217; life and career; &#8220;Build,&#8221; which shares Tony Fadell&#8217;s experiences developing the iPod and his unique approach to innovation; &#8220;Never Finished,&#8221; where David Goggins emphasizes the continuous nature of personal growth and mental resilience; &#8220;Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing,&#8221; Matthew Perry&#8217;s brutally honest memoir about his struggles with addiction; and &#8220;After Steve,&#8221; which delves into the transformation of Apple&#8217;s culture and identity after Jobs&#8217; passing, focusing on Jony Ive&#8217;s story.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Build: An Unorthodox Guide to Making Things Worth Making by Tony Fadell</h4>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Never Finished: Unshackle Your Mind and Win the War Within by David Goggins</h4>



<p>&#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Never-Finished-Unshackle-Your-Within/dp/B0BJ35MFZY?crid=1ZTJ9VT5PGJW8&amp;keywords=never+finished+by+david+goggins&amp;qid=1679425600&amp;sprefix=never+finish%2Caps%2C152&amp;sr=8-1">Never Finished: Unshackle Your Mind and Win the War Within</a>&#8221; is a powerful follow-up to David Goggins&#8217; first book, &#8220;Can&#8217;t Hurt Me.&#8221; In &#8220;Never Finished,&#8221; Goggins shares his experiences and insights on personal growth, emphasizing that the journey towards self-improvement is an ongoing process. </p>



<p>Goggins is&#8230; controversial&#8230; among my military friends. </p>



<p>He introduces new mental tools and strategies for overcoming fear, self-doubt, and negativity, drawing from his extensive experience as an endurance athlete and military veteran.</p>



<p>There isn&#8217;t a lot of new stuff in Never Finished, but I took away these three things:</p>



<ol>
<li>Embrace discomfort: Goggins highlights the importance of stepping outside our comfort zones and facing challenges head-on. By embracing discomfort, we develop mental resilience and learn valuable lessons that can help us overcome future obstacles.</li>



<li>Cultivate a growth mindset: Goggins encourages readers to develop a growth mindset, which involves viewing challenges as opportunities for growth rather than insurmountable barriers. By maintaining a growth mindset, we become more adaptable, resilient, and open to new experiences.</li>



<li>Share knowledge and empower others: Goggins stresses the value of sharing one&#8217;s knowledge and experiences to inspire and empower those around us. This creates a positive ripple effect that can change lives and communities, ultimately contributing to our own personal growth and success.</li>
</ol>



<p>&#8220;Never Finished: Unshackle Your Mind and Win the War Within&#8221; serves as a compelling reminder that the journey towards personal growth and mental resilience is a continuous process. By embracing challenges, cultivating mental resilience, and helping others, we can unlock our true potential and achieve greatness.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">After Steve: How Apple Became a Trillion-Dollar Company and Lost Its Soul by Tripp Mickle</h4>



<p>Noticing a trend yet <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>



<p>&#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/After-Steve-Became-Trillion-Dollar-Company/dp/0063009811">After Steve: How Apple Became a Trillion-Dollar Company and Lost Its Soul</a>,&#8221; explores the significant changes in Apple&#8217;s culture and direction following the death of Steve Jobs. One pivotal figure during this transition was Jony Ive, Apple&#8217;s Chief Design Officer, who played a crucial role in shaping the company&#8217;s design philosophy and product development.</p>



<p>The book delves into Ive&#8217;s relationship with Jobs, highlighting their shared passion for design and innovation. Under Jobs&#8217; mentorship, Ive helped create some of Apple&#8217;s most iconic products, such as the iMac, iPhone, and iPad. Their collaboration was marked by a mutual respect and trust, allowing them to push the boundaries of technology and design.</p>



<p>Following Jobs&#8217; passing, Ive found himself navigating a rapidly changing corporate landscape. The book emphasizes how Tim Cook&#8217;s leadership, with its focus on operational efficiency and profitability, shifted the company&#8217;s priorities, affecting the design process and Ive&#8217;s influence within Apple.</p>



<p>One key story in the book involves the development of the Apple Watch. While the product was ultimately successful, the process was marked by struggles to balance innovation and profitability. Ive faced challenges in maintaining the high standards of design and creativity that had defined Apple under Jobs, as the company&#8217;s priorities shifted towards financial success.</p>



<p>The author contends that Ive&#8217;s frustration with this new direction led to his eventual departure from Apple. The book argues that Ive&#8217;s exit marked a turning point, further illustrating the transformation of Apple&#8217;s culture and identity since Jobs&#8217; passing.</p>



<p>&#8220;After Steve: How Apple Became a Trillion-Dollar Company and Lost Its Soul&#8221; offers an insightful look into the evolving dynamics of Apple during a critical period of transition. By focusing on the story of Jony Ive, the book highlights the challenges faced by the company in maintaining its spirit of innovation and creativity, while navigating the demands of a trillion-dollar business.</p>

<p>In this episode of Scaleup Marketing, I talk about the Catch-22 of Attribution, and why fighting over attribution is destroying go-to-market teams.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Attribution Hunger Games" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="152" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/60lu89yPTC9HgWzcDhQav9?si=1TT8Ya5PTC6Mv0EeAc1ysQ&#038;utm_source=oembed"></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Okay. I want to talk a little bit about attribution. I wrote a post on LinkedIn called the catch 22 of growth. If you&#8217;re hitting your numbers, no one cares about attribution. You don&#8217;t have to waste time fighting over which channel or team gets credit, and you can make bets that aren&#8217;t direct response.</p>



<p>If you are missing your numbers, everyone cares about attribution fighting over attribution leads to investments that are easy to track. But aren&#8217;t going to help you hit the numbers teams spend more time fighting over credit than they do on focusing on what works. And I call this the catch 22 of growth because on the surface, you&#8217;d think that having more visibility into attribution would help you hit the number.</p>



<p>And in some cases that&#8217;s true. But what I&#8217;ve seen happen more often than not is teams who are missing their number. Hyper-focus on attribution, leading to teams battling each other over credit, which means instead of spending time, figuring out what&#8217;s working as a team, they&#8217;re focused on justifying their own [00:01:00] existence.</p>



<p>So when you think about a SaaS company and attribution, we&#8217;re thinking mostly about what sourcing new logos and there&#8217;s really three things that can source a new logo or a new pipeline. Marketing can source it through marketing investment or a marketing campaign. Sales can source an opportunity, whether it&#8217;s a, you know, a sales rep, finding a referral from an existing customer, whether it&#8217;s a BDR doing outbound prospecting, or if you&#8217;re an organization that has a channel, one of your channel partners can bring something to you.</p>



<p>And in each case I&#8217;m talking about a net new opportunity, something that we hadn&#8217;t seen before. So most, most organizations, including the one I work at recorded future set goals for each function, sales partners, marketing around how much we should contribute to pipeline into new era. And I think that&#8217;s healthy.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s good. We should have some [00:02:00] understanding of what&#8217;s working. What&#8217;s not working, but at the end of the day, what matters more than the success of any individual channel? Is is the go-to-market engine working. And if that go to market engine, isn&#8217;t working, the natural instinct is to go and try to figure out well, which of these things is not functioning.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s where the problems start because often what that causes is teams to get defensive about their slice of pipeline and revenue. And it turns out it&#8217;s incredibly difficult to do attribution correctly because how do you account for situations like marketing took credit for this opportunity? But it was, it was the reason they filled out a form on our website is because.</p>



<p>One of our existing customers told them to. So really it was a referral that drove this from sales and not the mine or the campaign that you thought that you got this great result from, or [00:03:00] same thing with the channel. You know, maybe somebody came into your database through a marketing program. A couple of years ago, been a cold lead sitting in HubSpot for a couple of years.</p>



<p>Channel partner brings the opportunity. To the business and puts it into Salesforce and it looks like a marketing source lead, and there&#8217;s a million different ways that this can go wrong. So on aligned organizations who aren&#8217;t hitting their numbers, their first instinct is all right, well, let&#8217;s go look at what the data tells us.</p>



<p>That data tells us that, you know, marketing is doing poorly or sales is doing well or whatever, whatever it is, let&#8217;s go figure out what&#8217;s broken there. When the reality is it isn&#8217;t. In almost all cases. It isn&#8217;t the effectiveness of a specific channel that should be in question. It&#8217;s the effectiveness of the overall go to market.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re never good. There&#8217;s no attribution product on the planet that can solve for the way that real [00:04:00] companies buy the real people buy. There&#8217;s just, it&#8217;s just not a direct response process anymore. And that was one of the points I made in my LinkedIn post. And I&#8217;ve seen this go horribly wrong before where it turns into a hunger game situation where you&#8217;ve got executives fighting with each other, for credit fighting to get resources from the organization.</p>



<p>And using flawed attribution data as the source of this. And what ends up happening is whoever&#8217;s best at Salesforce is able to make their case, but that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it was the actual right decision for the business or what&#8217;s happening in reality. So I implore everyone who&#8217;s in this situation, instead of looking at attribution as a hunger games, you know, winner takes all situation.</p>



<p>Partner with the other leaders in your organization, be data informed, come to the table [00:05:00] with an understanding of what you think attribution looks like, but, but don&#8217;t get obsessed with this group, missed their number by 10%. It&#8217;s the go to market success should be binary. It should be. We won or lost as a team, not marketing won or lost or sales won or lost or partner won or lost because none of these things work.</p>



<p>Independently. They work in tandem and don&#8217;t be the kind of organization that gets into these heated situations over which team gets credit for which deal. It just is not going to be healthy for the long-term future of your company. And I&#8217;m sorry, MarTech vendors. There just isn&#8217;t a product out there that is able to track the way that real organizations buy.</p>



<p>And I might argue, in some cases, it&#8217;s the attribution products that are a big cause of this because they overweight. The marketing [00:06:00] impact on growth. When the reality is there are lots of different misunderstood levers that will cause someone to come on our website, fill out a form, book a demo, and become an opportunity.</p>



<p>So that&#8217;s my quick take on attribution. I&#8217;m not saying that you shouldn&#8217;t be focused on attribution, that you shouldn&#8217;t have an understanding of what comes from where that you shouldn&#8217;t be tracking it. Monthly quarterly, you should be doing all of those. Just don&#8217;t be the kind of company that&#8217;s going to obsess over it to the point where you spend more time fighting for credit, then you do worrying about how are we going to go hit the number, because that&#8217;s all that really matters at the end of the day.</p>



<p>Okay. Before I forget, let me do some marketing. If you want to hear more hot takes like this, or even better, longer form interviews with smart people in SAS. Go ahead and hit the subscribe button scale up marketing. I&#8217;d really appreciate it. [00:07:00] Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:00:00] hey, Jamie, how are you? </p>



<p><strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:00:02] I&#8217;m good. Thanks, Tom. How are&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:00:03] you? I&#8217;m fantastic. Thanks for agreeing to do this with me.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:00:07] Happy to be here. Thanks for having me.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:00:09] So you&#8217;re a marketing operations, virtuoso, I think is the word I&#8217;ve called you&nbsp;</p>



<p>before.</p>



<p><strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:00:17] I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d use that word, but,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:00:18] About your, your background and path into marketing operations and how you&#8217;ve progressed to your current role at InVision.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:00:26] Sure. So when I started a long time ago in marketing ops, I didn&#8217;t actually know what it was. I sort of just fell into it and everything I found myself doing at my job.</p>



<p>Eventually my boss was like, you know, this is marketing operations, right? And so I read everything I could about really what that was and realized kind of, that was what I was interested in the technical side of marketing systems and reporting and data and how that all works together and trying to make marketing more of a science and not just an art.</p>



<p>And then since then by either by design or just by luck, I&#8217;ve had some mentors, yourself [00:01:00] included who have really believed in the importance of ops and, and giving up the seat at the table and resources and the ability to build a team. And, and a lot of chances to do that type of thing that, you know, maybe I wouldn&#8217;t have had at either different types of companies or different roles, but so far I&#8217;ve been able to build some really good teams and invest in some really cool tools and had a lot of opportunities that I&#8217;m really lucky.</p>



<p>I got to have.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:01:22] Cool and InVision you&#8217;ve, you&#8217;ve been individually for how long. It&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:01:26] was four years in October.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:01:27] Cool. And InVision has this enormous marketing funnel that you are the steward over, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:01:35] Yeah. What&#8217;s funny about InVision is we are a startup and a smaller kind of scrappier company and team, but we really do have big company problems.</p>



<p>We have this, you know, 10 million person database that we&#8217;re dealing with. So our problems are at a big scale and we have to deal with everything we have to do is around scale and around. Being able to sustain this large database and, you know, handle kind of systems that work at the [00:02:00] scale that we&#8217;re operating at,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:02:02] that was a subtle flax.</p>



<p>The 10 million, the 10 million database was a, that was a little bit of a flex on the audience. Huh?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:02:09] We did a Marquetto migration a few months back that we jokingly, barely survived, but. You know, I&#8217;ve done two of these now in my career. I really don&#8217;t ever want to do one again, but honestly, having done it at a small scale and then having done it now at a much larger scale, the problems you have or the not even problems, but the situations you have to deal with, the decisions you have to make at the size of database that InVision has.</p>



<p>The stakes are just so much higher. The systems and tools are out there. Aren&#8217;t always set up to work at the scale that we need to work at. And we don&#8217;t always have the resources to do something we&#8217;re not Amex. We&#8217;re not some huge company who has, you know, this massive budget and tons of people working around the clock.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s just a small team and we&#8217;re trying to make all this stuff work.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:02:51] So marketing, operation, something you&#8217;ve been doing for a while. It is a role that sort of came out of nowhere. At one point marketing ops, you know, [00:03:00] before marketing automation existed, I don&#8217;t know what they used to call marketing ops people back then, but it sort of came about as a result of Eloqua and HubSpot and Marquette and others.</p>



<p>But how do you define marketing operations?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:03:16] How I define it has honestly changed in the last several years. I would say when I started, it&#8217;s kind of what I thought about is more maybe traditional marketing operations around the funnel on processes, MarTech and your tech stack, the lead hand off with sales, things like that.</p>



<p>I think of that as kind of, that&#8217;s kind of always been the core to marketing ops reporting on ROI, that type of thing. In recent years, I&#8217;ve really noticed this trend towards more of this planning and strategy function of operations. So it&#8217;s everything from. What campaigns do we go to market with and how do we intake those campaigns and plan for them it&#8217;s around budget and decisions around your budget and how you spend it and allocate it.</p>



<p>OKR development tracking of your OKR revenue planning is a big one that I keep hearing being [00:04:00] talked about that kind of used to happen. And, you know, maybe in finance or behind closed doors or the board members would decide now, you know, marketing ops people are being asked to. You know, what revenue can marketing drive?</p>



<p>What number can you sign up for? How can it be a part of that revenue number that your company is trying to drive? And how do we model that and what should it look like? We&#8217;re involved in all of those conversations that I don&#8217;t think we always were. And I think that&#8217;s only helped to elevate the function and give it more of a seat at the table than ever really has had before, which makes me excited to be a part of it.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:04:29] I&#8217;ve always, I think I&#8217;ve written before. I&#8217;ve always thought of. I&#8217;ve always wanted marketing operations to report into me as the CML. And I&#8217;ve also always wanted the marketing operations role to be more of a chief of staff. But my question to you is, and it sounds like you&#8217;re playing that role right now in InVision.</p>



<p>How much? So are you, do you own like, talk about budget? Do you own the budget or are you more helping back decisions? Someone else&#8217;s making with data?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:04:59] That&#8217;s a [00:05:00] great question. I think of myself as I own the SAS budget and that I&#8217;m the person responsible for. Are we deploying these dollars that we&#8217;re using for SAS tools in the most appropriate way?</p>



<p>Is there a redundancy? Is there shelfware even for tools that my team really has nothing to do with maybe for the social media marketing tool or, you know, they&#8217;re a PR management tool or something like that. We may not be in them using them, but I think of myself as owning the SAS budget, how are we spending.</p>



<p>Are the tools deployed as well as they can be. Are they integrated correctly? Is the renewal being handled, right? You know, are we paying for this in the right way? Could we replace it with something else that we already have? Is there a better tech out there that we should be considering? That sort of where I think of myself as owning the budget on the kind of.</p>



<p>Program spend, I guess I think I&#8217;ve played different roles at different companies. Some companies it&#8217;s a bit more scientific. You remember, in our time at Aquia, we were down to the dollar, you know, how much our ad spend was, what we were getting from those [00:06:00] leads, cost per lead ROI metrics that kind of told us from finance, Hey, we need 500 K in this ad or whatever it was.</p>



<p>Other companies I think are a little bit less scientific about it and it&#8217;s more of just a percentage calculation, but I think I&#8217;ve seen it kind of the whole spectrum of ways you can do that.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:06:15] Are you allowed to say no? So let&#8217;s say that somebody wants to run some campaign and you have all the data that shows that historically that thing is just not going to work.</p>



<p>Do you have the ability, do you think someone in, in, in that sort of chief of staff role should have the ability to be able to sort of veto things?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:06:35] I like saying no, but I like doing it in a way that. Is a no, but so I think it&#8217;s the opposite of the yes. And philosophy that some people have. So I think for me, I spent a lot, it took me a while to get here.</p>



<p>When I started, I was trying to be everything for everyone. And I was trying to say yes to everything, but I pretty quickly learned that if something goes wrong, It&#8217;s really myself, who&#8217;s on the line. [00:07:00] So if we rush something out and, you know, send an incorrect campaign, or if we, you know, mess up targeting and an ad or something like that at the end of the day, I&#8217;m the person who&#8217;s on the hook for that.</p>



<p>So I really take pride in making sure that we have processes in place where, you know, we have our full process end to end. We can take the campaign in correctly, the right people review it. It goes through QA. It goes through the normal kind of channels for launch. And we only kind of. Deviate from that.</p>



<p>If it&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a real reason, there&#8217;s an urgent reason, a support issue that we have to announce or a really big opportunity that just presented itself. Aside from that, I like everything to really go through the right process in the right channels. And to only make exceptions, if there&#8217;s a real reason, if everything is an exception, then you don&#8217;t give yourself time to handle the actual exceptions.</p>



<p>Everything just becomes a special snowflake. So I really enjoy being able to make sure that things go through the right process and the right checks. And that if a campaign doesn&#8217;t feel impactful enough we don&#8217;t spend time on it. We don&#8217;t spend resources on it.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:07:59] I remember [00:08:00] I think it was you who built the, should we send this email calculator?</p>



<p>And it was, it was the dumb math of all right. You want to send an email to 400 people with a 30% open rate and a 4% click rate. You&#8217;re going to get that email in front of four people. So no, you should not send that email.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:08:19] Yup. That&#8217;s I love that calculator. And I definitely do that math and encourage my team to do that math all the time&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:08:25] should build that as a Chrome extension.</p>



<p>It would be a pretty simple point. Oh, absolutely. So talk about, so process is really important because what you just said to me sounds like it&#8217;s slow. You know, I work at a fast paced company. You&#8217;re you&#8217;re slowing me down. We&#8217;ve got to get this campaign out. COO said we don&#8217;t have time. How do you handle.</p>



<p>The, you know, how having a rigid process in the face of the business always won. Always being told to move faster, because this is something I struggle with in my company. I drive real things really fast here, [00:09:00] and I know there are consequences because of skipping some of the process stuff.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:09:05] I&#8217;m a believer that if you are thorough and follow the process, you&#8217;ll get better results and better quality from the things you&#8217;re doing.</p>



<p>And so we spend time thinking through, you know, look at all the available audiences and what message would work best for them, or looking at the full calendar and making sure that we space emails out correctly so that we get better. Open rates and click rates and lower unsub rates. So for me, it&#8217;s about getting more bang for your buck or more, more juice from the squeeze.</p>



<p>And so I think it&#8217;s really important to be thoughtful and get the most out of the activities you&#8217;re doing. The other thing that I think is important is we involved our stakeholders in the intake process. So we didn&#8217;t just sort of roll out this like. Super crazy process where people have to fill in a million forms to request the campaign.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s a huge headache. We sat down with the team and talked through. These are the things we need to know from you to launch a campaign. This is how we&#8217;re thinking of having you provide that info. Does this work for you? And they tested [00:10:00] it and they gave feedback on parts that were kind of friction, you know, had friction in them or parts that were simple and easy.</p>



<p>Then we built it together. So it didn&#8217;t really feel like us forcing a one size fits all sort of answer to it. We gave people buy-in and built buy-in with them to make it a more kind of team built process.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:10:19] What percent of the campaigns that you help support go through the process versus are the one-off escalations.</p>



<p><strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:10:31] Maybe, maybe there&#8217;s the occasional, but it wouldn&#8217;t even probably be a percentage point on the graph. I get mad at my team. If they go, I don&#8217;t actually get mad at them, but I I&#8217;m strict with my team on making sure that things follow the process. Because again, if they don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s me, right? Who&#8217;s the person, who&#8217;s the face of our email program and our digital messaging program.</p>



<p>And if it was important enough to do it was important enough to ask for it at the right time. And if [00:11:00] it wasn&#8217;t part of the planning process, then you know, nothing&#8217;s going to change. If it happens a week later, other than you&#8217;ll get a better campaign and it&#8217;ll probably have better results than if I rushed to get it out tomorrow.</p>



<p>Wow. I also don&#8217;t feel like my deadlines are that all of the deadlines are, I think they&#8217;re tight enough. Where I can defend them. We&#8217;re not saying we need six months to do something. So I feel, I feel good about the, the deadlines and SLS we&#8217;ve agreed on with our stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:11:24] So let&#8217;s say Brian, Kardon, your COO comes to you and says, Jamie, we really need to get this thing out real quickly.</p>



<p>Sorry. You say no to your CO2? Or does he get a pass?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:11:36] I&#8217;ll let you know if he does know. I think I think there&#8217;s obviously exceptions, but I think for the most part, the way we would handle it, it&#8217;s not a, no, it&#8217;s an, it&#8217;s a, you know, yes, we can do it. I guess this is my yes. And right. It&#8217;s yes, we can do it and we&#8217;ll be able to do it on this date.</p>



<p>And the reason I think he respects me more for being able to say, if we do it in the timeframe that we&#8217;re supposed to be doing these things. I&#8217;ll make sure it&#8217;s, you know, error-free, [00:12:00] it&#8217;ll go to the audience, you know, this week they already got an email next week. They don&#8217;t have one scheduled. There&#8217;s all those sorts of things that I think for the most part are pretty well understood.</p>



<p>Now the exception is probably sales. So sometimes sales says, Hey, we have this huge renewal at risk. Can you help us spin something up? So we do reserve resources on our teams to handle that kind of thing. And so, but we know we have a kind of programmatic way to handle it. We are aware that that&#8217;s going to come and we save some time in our work schedules and calendars to handle that.</p>



<p>But everything else I kind of make go through the right channels.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:12:32] And how, w D was this something that was already in place before you got to InVision? Or is this a process you put in place when you joined.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:12:39] Definitely wasn&#8217;t already in place before I joined on all of the marketing ops function really has been built over the last few years.</p>



<p>I think it&#8217;s been a joint effort between demand gen my, my team. Some of our other stakeholders that we&#8217;ve really built collaboratively. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s something where I don&#8217;t think it would work if it was just one team being like, this is the way we&#8217;re doing it. Everyone has [00:13:00] to follow. I think it&#8217;s really been kind of a give and take in a collaborative process.</p>



<p>We also have someone on the team, who&#8217;s a magician with automation. So you fill in a form and it like magically creates things in a sauna and on calendars and fills out forms for you. So she&#8217;s made it really go from being what could have been like this arduous process to something that seems streamlined and easy.</p>



<p>Which really, I think helps.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:13:23] Got it. So was there any friction, so rolling out process. I can imagine if you&#8217;re used to. Just getting stuff, just do it mentality. Is it hard for companies to make that switch to getting? Cause I feel like it recorded future. We&#8217;re a little bit in that same stage where we&#8217;ve got we&#8217;re much bigger than we used to be.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve got many more we&#8217;ve you know, we used to have one product now we have six, so we&#8217;ve got six different teams, all wanting to get their campaigns out. And yet we don&#8217;t have that kind of rigid process. How do you make a process stick?&nbsp;</p>



<p>[00:14:00] <strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:14:00] I think I&#8217;ve been able to prove it with data and that we&#8217;ve been able to show that if you&#8217;re more thoughtful about the audience and the segmentation for your emails, you get better engagement rates, your unsubscribe rates go down and things like that.</p>



<p>And so we do actually, we did this Aquia too, but we do a monthly calendar review here. Or we look at the next month and the rest of the quarter. And we look at the available audiences and the campaigns people want to run and we slot them in accordingly. So I think part of it is prove it with data show the, what happens.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re more thoughtful about your targeting, you put more time into it. You have more review cycles and better quality. Maybe you going to have time to run AB tests or test your audience, segmentation, things like that. You&#8217;ll get better results and more out of your campaign. And we&#8217;re talking, I&#8217;m talking about a few days delay here, like a week delay.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re not talking months. So I think to me that the, the trade-off seems well worth it.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:14:52] No, fair enough. So. I need&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:14:56] to address also I have three little kids. And [00:15:00] so I understand that if you don&#8217;t set boundaries, you will get walked all over. So if I just, you know, let them this one time, it&#8217;s a special snowflake, you know, they&#8217;re gonna, they&#8217;re gonna abuse that.</p>



<p>So I kind of apply that same principle to work where. The rules are here for the good of all of us. It&#8217;s not me being a stickler or anything like that. It&#8217;s really because this is the path that we&#8217;ve agreed on as a leadership team works for our company. And so I take my, my parenting principles with three little monsters running around and I try to bring those to kind of the, the programs plan at InVisions.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:15:33] It&#8217;s good training for you. So you&#8217;ve talked about team a few times. How do you, so talk to me about your team? Like what the roles are, how do you organize them?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:15:42] Sure. Yeah. Like I said before, I think I&#8217;ve been able to be at companies that believed in marketing ops. So I think it&#8217;s easy to be like, Oh, we&#8217;ll hire one more program&#8217;s person, because you can quantify one person runs X number of programs with X ROI.</p>



<p>I think that&#8217;s a little bit harder in ops roles because we&#8217;re more behind [00:16:00] the scenes. So I think I&#8217;ve been lucky to have mentors and bosses who have respected what goes into a solid marketing ops team and given me the ability to build my team. And so right now I&#8217;ve got kind of, I have three areas that I look after.</p>



<p>One is kind of the traditional marketing ops that I was talking about around the funnel and around the lead handoff and systems and technology. Then I run the digital messaging team and the digital messaging team is email our website chat in our in-app chat. And then I recently took over the SDR team, the inbound sales kind of up team.</p>



<p>And the thought there is that these are the regenerating, the marketing leads and sending them to sales. And now we&#8217;re more closely aligned with the team that is following up. So making sure that they can handle these responses at scale, that they&#8217;re using all the tools and technology to the best of their ability that they understand measurement and how we&#8217;re looking at SLS and conversion rates and things like that.</p>



<p>So kind of bringing those all together under my team seem to make sense, we&#8217;ll see [00:17:00] how it plays out, but that was a pretty recent change.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:17:03] Wow. That&#8217;s an unusual structure that, that doesn&#8217;t re rarely lives in ops, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:17:09] Yeah, I think so. I think for us at having such a large inbound funnel, like we were talking about earlier, You know, incremental improvements and process and up can have, you know, huge results down the line.</p>



<p>So I think the team sees that. And so my team also runs all the followup cadences around like automated leads, where we test messaging and test things to drive up open rates and clicks and things like that. So it kind of makes sense because, you know, from that sampling, we&#8217;re already doing a lot of the followup and messaging stuff.</p>



<p>And now we&#8217;ll have the STR kind of role in there as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:17:42] Cool. That&#8217;s cool. The, the, the STRs, like being in, or are they in sales previously?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:17:48] They in sales previously so far they&#8217;ve seemed positive. I think they get it because they. They understand how kind of the marketing leads and the health of those marketing leads.</p>



<p>And the followup process is so [00:18:00] integral to them hitting their quota. So they actually feel like they have a closer alignment and more buy-in and more levers to pull, to get to their quota than I think they did before. So they&#8217;re actually excited to have these weekly meetings with the people on my team about, you know, making sure that they see all their leads and how many touches they&#8217;re doing and you know, what types are they following up with and running free reheating campaigns and re-engagement campaigns.</p>



<p>They&#8217;re jazzed about that because they see it as a path to get to their quota, which is really what they care about.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:18:29] Yeah.&nbsp; How are you measured, annually?</p>



<p>What are your OKR is that you&#8217;re held to.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:18:36] That&#8217;s a great question. Definitely on the sales side, it&#8217;s kind of easy to answer that because it&#8217;s just around a number of opportunities. And then I think beyond that, there&#8217;s a part of my team that owns channel health. So I&#8217;m looking, we&#8217;re measuring, you know, how email is performing and contributing to the business, how our website chat and how our in-app chat are performing and contributing to the business.</p>



<p>So those are monetary and you can measure those relatively easily. [00:19:00] On the marketing ops side or kind of the traditional marketing ops side for me, a really important metric is around conversion rate because if you&#8217;re qualifying the right leads and sending them over and pushing that in the right direction and then, you know, hitting your targets.</p>



<p>I think that&#8217;s really what we care about. And so that side of the team owns lead scoring and lead routing. And what we&#8217;re, what are we doing for followup and all of that kind of type of thing. So they are really able to influence that conversion rate and opportunity number more so than maybe some other teams.</p>



<p>So those are kind of the big ticket ones. And then beyond that, we always have a line items that are OKR is around projects or tech implementations or things like that.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:19:40] Got it. So it&#8217;s more like there&#8217;s no one who owns a number around certainly around opportunity creation, but there&#8217;s not like a conversion rate improvement number or, or is there&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:19:52] I&#8217;ve had them.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve had quarters where we have had that if we have been implementing a specific activity aligned to that, but not [00:20:00] every quarter, but one quarter we may be rolling out a new lead scoring tool. And the thing we&#8217;re going to measure is that it could be increased conversion rate 10%. But I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s something that is maybe happens every single quarter.</p>



<p>Got&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:20:11] it. So what does a typical daylight look for you? So we&#8217;ve talked a lot about what you, what your team and where your team spends their time as the, and how many people are on your team.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:20:21] I have a few open heads right now. I think when all is said and done, we&#8217;ll be probably around 12. Wow. I have to manage teams at InVision upwards of 26 to 30 people.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve managed different functions, including the web developers, including the project management group, things like that. As we&#8217;ve gone through some reorgs and. Re strategy what&#8217;s that, that I say re strategy as we&#8217;ve gone through some, as we&#8217;ve gone through some reorgs and kind of repositioning of focused on the marketing team, that&#8217;s gone up and down and changed a bit.</p>



<p>But yeah, I&#8217;ve managed up to, I think, 30 people or so at a time. Wow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[00:21:00] <strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:21:00] So what does your day look like other than, I guess probably just doing zoom one-on-ones or for&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:21:05] all day. Zoom calls. That&#8217;s what my day looks like. PowerPoint decks and zoom calls, I think is what my middle name is. I mean, not really is a lot of it, to be honest, but for me, it&#8217;s around making sure that I&#8217;m keeping an eye on.</p>



<p>The big ticket items and the big numbers that matter and not losing focus and going down rabbit holes or being too reactive when it comes to requests. So I think for me, I&#8217;m just trying to keep the team focused on the things that matter, trying to hold the guardrails for them around keeping their focus and not getting dragged into projects that maybe aren&#8217;t aligned to the team&#8217;s goals or the company&#8217;s goals removing blockers for them around, you know, getting things done.</p>



<p>I think there&#8217;s a lot. There&#8217;s a big component around data, quarterly business reviews, yearly business reviews revenue planning, and alignment with other teams. And then I think for me, it&#8217;s important to build relationships within sales ops, regular sales, [00:22:00] finance, business technology, and I spend time working on those relationships and working cross-functionally with those groups beyond arcade.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:22:08] What&#8217;s the biggest misconception about marketing ops?</p>



<p>&nbsp;I think the misconception is that marketing ops is about marketing automation. I think for so long, the role was so tied to a tool like HubSpot, Marketo Pardot. When what you just described, what your team does and you do is such a different, such a much bigger thing.</p>



<p>You didn&#8217;t mention. Marketing automation really wants other than to talk about. How big your database was.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:22:40] I think for me I&#8217;m trying to build a team of people that are dangerous in a whole bunch of different areas.</p>



<p>So we have people on the team that own quote, unquote, different tools or pieces of technology, but we don&#8217;t want single points of failure. And we don&#8217;t want people who can just do one thing. So we really do have kind of shared [00:23:00] competencies across the group. Anyone can jump into drift and create a campaign on the team, even if their day-to-day role isn&#8217;t related to drift and website chat, or anyone can send an email, even if their core job is it about deploying emails.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s important to me to make sure that people understand every piece of what goes into a campaign in, and if someone needs help or if bandwidth is tight in one area, we can all accommodate that. I mean, I think it keeps us from being too siloed. And that&#8217;s when, when you&#8217;re super siloed, I think that&#8217;s when breakdowns and efficiency can happen because you&#8217;re only focused on like you&#8217;re one cog in the wheel or you&#8217;re one little piece, I&#8217;d rather have a team that is kind of multifunctional and dangerous.</p>



<p>There he is. But I still, I still do try to make sure that everybody knows those, what they would have to wake up and worry about. So even if you know, someone, isn&#8217;t the person worrying about drifts, someone else is, and someone else is looking every day at. Response rates for conversations and traffic and conversion and performance of different bots and things like that.</p>



<p>So being clear on swim lanes, I guess, of who owns what, who does, who is [00:24:00] responsible for what, but then making sure people can help each other and can be successful in all different areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:24:06] All right, Jamie, I&#8217;ve got one last question for you. So we talked about, we just talked about how marketing ops is not just about tech, but I&#8217;m going to ask you a tech question anyway.</p>



<p>So if you had to throw out everything, you can only keep one piece of, of your tech stack. What would you keep? And it can&#8217;t be Marketa.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:24:27] I could only keep one piece of my tech stack and it can&#8217;t be Marquetto.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:24:32] Hmm, put another way. Tell us something cool that you&#8217;re doing that that no one else is doing. And you want to, you want to educate the world on,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:24:46] I could only keep one piece of technology aside from Marquetto no,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:24:50] you had to throw my cattle out to throw it out. I&#8217;ll let you keep it. You can it up. Okay. But only one other,&nbsp;</p>



<p>[00:25:00] <strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:25:00] only one other one that I think is particularly cool is Pendo. In Pendo you&#8217;re able to it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a digital message, digital messaging tool within your product or your app.</p>



<p>And so for us, you know, what&#8217;s cool about Pendo is you&#8217;re you&#8217;re getting to people where they&#8217;re working. So with email, I think you&#8217;re trying to reach them. Maybe they&#8217;re just watching TV and reading their email, or maybe they&#8217;re, you know, hopefully not driving and reading their email, but maybe they&#8217;re in the car or they&#8217;re at their kid&#8217;s school pickup line.</p>



<p>So it can be hard to get them to do an action that you want them to do from their inbox. What I like about Pendo is you can reach people while they&#8217;re working and you can offer them related tips, you know, here to do the next thing. Or this is a related piece of content. You can get super targeted on what you&#8217;re offering and how you&#8217;re offering it.</p>



<p>And I think the challenge for us has been. The time to really explore what you can do and the ability to build kind of Daisy, Daisy chain campaigns and things like that. So we&#8217;ve been a bit sort of execution focused so far, but I&#8217;m hopeful that [00:26:00] this year we can really kind of up the ante with Kendo and think about it as a tool that we can use for everything to help from onboarding all the way through the whole life cycle with our customers and use it as a real engagement tool to drive deeper use of our product.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:26:15] Awesome. Well, Jamie, thanks so much. I think we talked a lot about what I was hoping to talk about, which is how strategic marketing operations can be when done. Right. And obviously you&#8217;ve done it right over to InVision. So thanks for taking some time for me today. Thanks&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jamie Sloan: </strong>[00:26:29] Tom. It&#8217;s always fun to chat with you and I appreciate you having me, Jamie.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:26:33] Bye.</p>

<p>In this week&#8217;s episode of Scaleup Marketing, I talk about why I decided to start a podcast, what I&#8217;m hoping to get out of it, and why I think everyone should start their own podcast. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Spotify Embed: Why I Started a Podcast (and Why You Should Too)" style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="152" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/48XQVGg2PaOlOYx0TnjS96?si=RTGgW8T3S1-29nkJT5DRYQ&#038;utm_source=oembed"></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>By the way, as I mention in the podcast it takes me about 90 minutes to product each episode. It would probably take even less time if I outsourced some of the production but I&#8217;m an audio nerd and I like doing it myself <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s my production workflow: </p>



<ul><li>I record episodes in Zoom. Everyone has Zoom and it works really well, especially for audio. Here&#8217;s a little Zoom tip: If you have a guest on your podcast, select &#8220;Record a separate audio file for each participant&#8221;. That way in post-production you can adjust volume levels more easily in case you need to. </li></ul>

<ul><li>Next, I bring the Zoom audio file(s) into one of my favorite products of the past few years, <a href="https://www.descript.com" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.descript.com">Descript</a>. Descript is a magical podcast production tool that really can handle almost the entire process by itself, but I use it for editing. With Descript you can edit the podcast from the text transcript it automatically creates. You can even remove &#8220;ummms&#8221; and &#8220;ahhhs&#8221; with a single click. </li></ul>

<ul><li>Then I export the audio from Descript into Logic Pro to add in my intro + exit music and add some audio effects like EQ and compression. This step is 100% overkill as you can do almost all of what I do in Descript.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Lastly I export the final audio file and upload it to <a href="https://anchor.fm" data-type="URL" data-id="https://anchor.fm">Anchor</a>, a podcast distribution tool that will publish the episode to all the usual places and provide some analytics.</li></ul>

<p>Like I said, this entire process typically takes me less than 90 minutes end-to-end. And best of all, all of those tools are free (except for Logic Pro, but you could also do the same with Apple&#8217;s GarageBand). </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s the transcript:</p>



<p><br>Tom Wentworth: [00:00:00] On this week&#8217;s episode of scale-up marketing. I talked to Tom Wentworth about, all right, let&#8217;s kill the entry music, everybody. So I&#8217;m now done about 10 episodes of this scale up marketing podcast. And I wanted to take a little bit of a step backwards and talk about why I started a podcast, what I was hoping to achieve from starting a podcast.<br>And more importantly, why I think everybody should start a podcast. So the history of this podcast goes back to a one-on-one. I had with the CEO at recorded future Christopher Ahlberg and we were walking on the bike path behind our office over the summer. And we were talking about networking. This is something Christopher does really well.<br>He networks with other CEOs to be able to learn from them. And he encouraged me to start spending more time networking. As we get bigger as a company, every quarter or six months, it&#8217;s like recorded future as a brand new company. And networking is a great way just to stay [00:01:00] ahead of our growth by talking to other people who&#8217;ve gone through and experienced similar challenges.<br>So, as we were talking about an ARCA networking, I came up with a bright idea to start a podcast. What better way to force consistent networking and starting a weekly or bi-weekly podcast. It&#8217;s a great way to get guests to network with, Hey, do you want to be my podcast? It&#8217;s pretty easy to do that. And he thought it was a great idea.<br>So lo and behold, it became one of my my goals. And I had to start a podcast and it turns out it&#8217;s been a great way for me to network. So I&#8217;ve been able to talk to people like Dave Kellogg. Who&#8217;s one of the original SAS marketing guys. He started a blog called Kel blog.com. He&#8217;s been blogging since 2004, I think.<br>And I got to have Dave on as my first guest and he taught me something that I use in every interview and he calls it the four pillars of being a CMO. And if you&#8217;re a COO there&#8217;s four things you can be good at. [00:02:00] You really can only be great at two, so you can either be great at managing inside sales teams.<br>You can be great at comms and PR you can be great at product marketing or you can be great at demand gen. So I asked that question in my interviews, every time I talked to somebody, you know, what are your, what are your two greatest pillars? I talked to Eric share the former COO of carbon black. We talked about messaging and how important it is to consistently repeat messaging over months, quarters, years, decades.<br>And it&#8217;s something that I think marketers often get too excited about changing messaging too often. So I&#8217;ve had these amazing conversations with people and it almost every conversation I&#8217;ve had, I&#8217;ve been able to take away one or two points that I&#8217;ve been able to bring with me as the CMO recorded future.<br>So my objective in starting this was selfishly just to be able to talk to smart people, to learn a little bit from them and to be able to apply a couple of things that I&#8217;ve learned in each episode to what I [00:03:00] do daily or in future. I didn&#8217;t really care if anyone listened. And it turns out some people, listen, I think I&#8217;ve had about a thousand people download the podcast.<br>So not a massive audience, but not zero. And that&#8217;s been a little bit of a pleasant surprise, but it almost doesn&#8217;t matter. Like I said, selfishly, it was most important for me to be able to pick out some things that I could learn. I do think though, recording the podcast has the benefit of now everyone else who takes a chance and listen to this podcast.<br>Can also now learn some of the same lessons that I learned. So it&#8217;s been a really great way for me to selfishly learn. I hope it&#8217;s been valuable for others, but that really wasn&#8217;t the primary reason of, of starting this podcast. It was selfishly for myself, but I think everyone should start a podcast for all the reasons that I just talked about.<br>But with the additional reason of building a personal brand, I&#8217;ve been doing this long enough that I&#8217;ve been able to build a personal brand in [00:04:00] other ways, just through longevity. But if you&#8217;re just starting in this business, what a great way to be able to stand out among everyone else who does what you do then by having a podcast.<br>And I think of like, if I were just starting off in marketing, if I were to my first job out of school, I would find a couple of other people who are also fresh out of marketing. And I talk about what it&#8217;s like to do marketing, you know, as a very junior person in marketing, or if I were a BDR and I was doing my first BDR job, I&#8217;d find a couple of other BDRs at other companies.<br>And talk about, do a podcast about best practices for being a new BDR. I think no matter where you are in your career, no matter what you do. You can find an audience that&#8217;s going to react well to what you want to talk about. Maybe it&#8217;s not a massive audience. Maybe you&#8217;re not going to be the next Gary V the next Dave Gearhart.<br>But I do think that you can build an audience by talking about something that other like-minded people care about. And podcasting is so easy to do [00:05:00] these days. I spend about maybe 90 minutes a week. So it takes me about 45 minutes to edit, sorry to record a podcast episode. I use zoom. It takes me then about 45 minutes to produce the episode.<br>I do it all myself, but there are easy ways to outsource parts of it too. So in about an hour and a half each week, I&#8217;m able to create this episode, get it up on podcast platform and, and get it out to the world. So it&#8217;s really not even a huge time investment. So I think if you&#8217;re. No matter where you are in your career an hour and a half a week, to be able to learn from other people, to be able to build out your own platform with your own message that you can show, you know, the other companies, the company you work for and other companies you&#8217;re looking at.<br>I don&#8217;t, you know, I&#8217;ve had a few candidates I&#8217;ve talked to over the years. That have been able to show me they started a podcast or started a blog or started a commerce site. And [00:06:00] those candidates a hundred percent of the time stand out because it shows their commitment to the craft of marketing. And I think starting a podcast is such an easy way to do that.<br>So thanks for listening. And you were one of the things that I&#8217;ve been horrible at with this podcast is asking for people to subscribe. So if you do like this or like any of the episodes I&#8217;ve recorded, I would love it for you to subscribe. So please go ahead and do that. There&#8217;s any questions that I can answer for you?</p>



<p><br>Feel free to go. He hit me up on my blog, tomwentworth.com or on LinkedIn. And thanks for listening.</p>

<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:00:00] Hey Rene, how are you? I&#8217;m doing great Tom. Good to talk&nbsp;</p>



<p>to you again. It&#8217;s good to talk to you as well. So just give us a little bit of background on yourself and the chasm&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Rene White: </strong>[00:00:07] group. So I&#8217;ve been with the chasm group for believe it or not 17 years. And before that a decade or so in operating roles at Oracle and a typical software and interwoven three public companies in a head of marketing roles.</p>



<p>And then before that long career in consulting had my own firm for awhile, probably the only thing anybody would remember is that my little firm made the original tracking and shipping software for FedEx which was just, just before the internet. And browsers came on board. And then before that I go, I go back far enough in Silicon Valley that I was actually Steve jobs, his personal marketing guy for five years.</p>



<p>Wow. I don&#8217;t think I knew that. Oh yeah. I worked for a little marketing firm that maybe a lot of people in the Silicon Valley that [00:01:00] are slightly older remembering this to Regis McKenna, of course. Yeah. So I was I headed up the applicant and, and my, my role was. Basically you know, market Steve jobs, which was 50% getting them into, you know, the right places in 50% of it was keeping them out of the wrong places&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:01:23] as, as, as the role of any good agency with any CEO.</p>



<p>So congrats for&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Rene White: </strong>[00:01:28] you. Yeah, exactly. Well, it might&#8217;ve been a little harder with him than, than most. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:01:35] I just got the chills. I&#8217;m a huge Steve jobs guy. And of course we just, McKenna was so instrumental to Apple&#8217;s early days.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Rene White: </strong>[00:01:41] Wow.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:01:43] So we&#8217;re going to talk, it&#8217;s about positioning today. Something I know you&#8217;re passionate about. Classically positioning is something I think that&#8217;s certainly under appreciated. That&#8217;s done almost wrong. A hundred percent of the time. And for a [00:02:00] lot of companies, they think of positioning. They go Google, what is positioning?</p>



<p>They go find some flavor of the standard Madlib positioning statement for target buyers. Your offering is a market category, which provides benefits, unlike competitors who provide competitors benefits. And that&#8217;s how they think of positioning, which is obviously wrong and incredibly oversimplified. So for you, who&#8217;s a positioning pro.</p>



<p>How do you define positioning and what specific mean to&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Rene White: </strong>[00:02:30] you? Yeah, I&#8217;ll try to make this as simple as possible because I think he points something out and that is the, the classic definition or the tenants for doing it just, just is not relevant anymore, but you still gotta make it so that it&#8217;s it has the right, the right point of of a pointy sword.</p>



<p>So what I mean by this is. You know, positioning should be the essence of who you are as it relates to your market. But, but [00:03:00] notice something, I didn&#8217;t say what you do for a living, which is the common misconception or outcome of a positioning statement. Is it, it focuses too much on what you do and really the marketplace or potential buyers they&#8217;re interested in.</p>



<p>Who are you?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:03:23] And who are you not right.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Rene White: </strong>[00:03:25] Yeah. Relative obviously, relative to other competitors, people that supply the same thing or similar, and maybe, maybe just as important, especially these days in, in business to business, but I&#8217;m sure it also relates in consumer marketing is doing nothing is probably your biggest competitor in a marketplace these days.</p>



<p>Why, why don&#8217;t I just do nothing or I didn&#8217;t know. I need to do that. Or you know, maybe more importantly why should I care about what you do?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:03:57] Yeah, it is ironic, right? [00:04:00] We&#8217;re in sales kickoff season and we talk a lot about competitors. You&#8217;re right. By far the biggest competitive loss at any company has, is the do nothing competitor, but no one ever talks about it.</p>



<p><strong>Rene White: </strong>[00:04:11] Yeah. Well for, especially for younger companies that are trying to innovate that a marketplace or even create a category it&#8217;s incredibly risky for most customers to take a chance on something new. So the answer, the safest thing they can do is chest hunker down and say, why don&#8217;t I do nothing? I can&#8217;t get fired for that.</p>



<p>Well, let&#8217;s put it this way. It&#8217;s a lot harder to get fired for that than it is to like take a chance, spend some budget and have it not go well. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:04:43] So what makes in your mind, what makes great positioning? It&#8217;s easy to point out flawed positioning, but what are the attributes when you do your research?</p>



<p>What are the attributes of really great position?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Rene White: </strong>[00:04:52] Right. So yeah, a couple of things. And, and again, you know, I, I think positioning has evolved greatly since that template [00:05:00] that you talked about. You know great positioning identifies you with your customer&#8217;s view of the world and then shows why only you can help them either fix a problem with that view of the world.</p>



<p>The problem they&#8217;re having with it, or helps them aspire to something bigger. So today, you know, that really means it needs to be connected to a story, something, something bigger than trying to automate a task or. I, you know, we sell seed on an&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:05:30] airplane. Yeah. I think what, what, what we all call back in the day?</p>



<p>Speeds and feeds. No one&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Rene White: </strong>[00:05:36] cares. Yeah, no one cares. No one cares. And it&#8217;s really nice that you do that. And this, this goes back actually to my, literally to my Steve jobs, you know, era of working with him. If one of the things that I noticed very early on in working with him was he always, when, when we talked to.</p>



<p>Industry analysts or financial analysts or the press, you know, time [00:06:00] magazine, whatever it might be. He always started with why I believe in what I believe. And then he would talk about, so therefore this is what I&#8217;m doing. And in that era, it was always interesting. Cause we, we were always running into, you know, and obviously the world knows that, you know, they, he had a relationship with bill Gates and you know, back and forth sometimes really positive sometimes.</p>



<p>A little bit more adversarial, but, but bill Gates would always start with the wet instead of the why. And you know, the, what does, if you start with the what and say, here&#8217;s our shiny object, aren&#8217;t you impressed, you know, people shut down, but if you start with, I believe in this. If you believe in it too, then my answer to how I&#8217;m going to work with that is probably going to go over a lot quicker than my bright, shiny object.</p>



<p>Yeah. And starting with that.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:06:53] And I feel like, you know, Apple&#8217;s position of it just works. You know, some flavor of that was, you know, talk [00:07:00] about bill Gates and Microsoft everyone&#8217;s experience was, well, Microsoft just doesn&#8217;t work. Blue screens of death and viruses and malware and slow downs. And I think that positioning obviously is helped Apple for a few decades at this point.</p>



<p><strong>Rene White: </strong>[00:07:15] Yeah. And I, again, I think it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a good example of the real difference between great positioning and mediocre positioning is focusing on the why, why it matters in why should I care about you?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:07:29] How does positioning relate to category creation? So you&#8217;re a lot of talk around B2B SAS, these days of category creation, and everyone is aspiring to be a category.</p>



<p>Creator is positioning come before category creation after how do you think about it?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Rene White: </strong>[00:07:46] It&#8217;s a really good question. You know, trying to create a category is probably the hardest job that marketing could ever do. And it&#8217;s also a long haul, Tom. It it takes time. You know, you don&#8217;t, you don&#8217;t reinvent.</p>



<p>People&#8217;s thinking [00:08:00] about what they should buy or what they should do. You know, in a nanosecond, it just, people just, it takes time and there&#8217;s a whole, you know, the chasm group is all about kind of that whole adoption curve and yeah. You know, some people get it right away because they just love fun, new things.</p>



<p>And most of the marketplace, you know, it was very pragmatic. About things. So, you know, this whole, you know, does the, just the category happened before the, no, you, if you&#8217;re going to create a category, you have to educate the marketplace on something they don&#8217;t think they need. And, and once you educate them, then, then you have to help them figure out.</p>



<p>Well if that&#8217;s the case, how do I specifically need it? And who else is needing this and using it. And then maybe then maybe after all of that if I&#8217;m past that in believe that is valuable to me, then I&#8217;m ready to buy. Then it&#8217;s a real category. But you know, categories are made by [00:09:00] pragmatic buyers who just want to fix a process.</p>



<p>Where they want to aspire to make a process better notice. I said, process, not a task. So this is, this is not selling a tool to a user because it&#8217;s the pragmatic buyer who says I I&#8217;ve got to. I I&#8217;m like those kind of people in. I want to do that. Yeah. And that&#8217;s where you get all the customers. And that&#8217;s when a category is a real category.</p>



<p>Or you can, you can sell 15% of the marketplace that are early adopters and never make it past them because you never understood how to sell to to pragmatic buyers. I&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:09:40] think that happens. We look at all of these well-funded startups who are growing like rocket ships in their early stages. They triple ARR from three to nine to 18, but.</p>



<p>And they want to be category creators, but you&#8217;re right. Like these, these early stage buyers, they get all distraction right upfront and they hit [00:10:00] a wall. And it&#8217;s because to your point, the sort of laggard buyers that help create a category need to be marketed to differently. And I feel like a lot of the reasons you hear about these startups who flame out is because they&#8217;re just not, they&#8217;re not prepared for the real world of the pragmatic buyer.</p>



<p><strong>Rene White: </strong>[00:10:18] Yeah. The, the old saw on is, is whatever made you successful in the early stages of building your category will, will not make you successful going forward because the buyer just doesn&#8217;t relate to what you&#8217;re talking about. I, one example I have is I, I worked with a a company in the tele-health area and this was.</p>



<p>I started with him maybe eight years ago and working with the CEO and the original problem that they had, they came to me for was their, their sales had plateaued and they didn&#8217;t understand why. So we dug into their their, their Salesforce history for the past 18 months and realized that.</p>



<p>[00:11:00] When do we talk to salespeople about what kind of buyers they were selling up to that point? They were all those kind of early adopter kind of buyers that said, Oh, telehealth is pretty cool. I liked that, you know, we want a robot in our ER. And then they get a wall because they&#8217;d sold all those people and of the 1300 hospitals in the United States.</p>



<p>And when they got past that. They were pragmatic buyers who basically said, well, why do I need that? So their whole sales approach was for early adopters and that sales approach did not work with pragmatic buyers. Their sales flattened. We changed the whole way. We talked to pragmatic buyers that were in there, their sales funnel, and sales went up in, in something like 16 months went up for 25%.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:11:51] So I&#8217;ll, I&#8217;ll net that out for you. If you&#8217;re one of these startups that, that sells to other startups and you&#8217;ve grown really fast, you better go talk to Rene because the [00:12:00] minute you run out of startups to sell to, and you&#8217;ve got to go sell to pragmatic buyers, the, your world is going to flip upside down.</p>



<p>And I see that happens so many&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Rene White: </strong>[00:12:08] times. Yeah. And Tom, the good news here is that you know, you&#8217;re not, you&#8217;re not recreating the wheel, you&#8217;re not coming up with whole cloth. It&#8217;s been done, you know, many times before and the companies that don&#8217;t recognize that generally don&#8217;t make it that much further and sell the company or, you know, pack it up.</p>



<p>And real leaders figure that out and run like heck in the right direction and do the right things.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:12:36] So talking about that. So one of the things that you do in your current role at chasm group is you help companies in lots of different ways, but how do you sort of scope when somebody comes to you and says they want it, they want your help with positioning.</p>



<p>First of all, who is that? Who comes to you? Is it the COO, the CEO? Where do you usually get this request&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Rene White: </strong>[00:12:56] from? Yeah, again from one of two people, [00:13:00] either the COO who has been tasked by the board or the, or the CEO with you know, we really need to really need to up our game in talking to the marketplace.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s time. We&#8217;re growing up. And the, and the COO is tasked with the responsibility to do it. And you know, my bias is they&#8217;re smart enough not to try to just do it. In-house And then the second one is the CEO calls me up or text me and, and basically out of frustration that the team isn&#8217;t getting to the place that they want to get.</p>



<p>And mostly what&#8217;s that&#8217;s about is the positioning just isn&#8217;t big enough against what we think we&#8217;re really, you know, so great at yeah.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:13:48] I think the seat when the CEO, when marketing owns it, it becomes the marketing positioning, which is useful, but not necessarily foundational when the [00:14:00] CEO drives it, it becomes the company messaging.</p>



<p>And I think it also becomes the company strategy. When you align everybody against great positioning, then it gives clarity to the R and D team. It gives clarity to customer success. It gives clarity data to. To everybody who touches the customer, right.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Rene White: </strong>[00:14:18] You bring up a really important point. And that is in a way, positioning is the tail that wags the dog.</p>



<p>It is, it is the revelation of what they could be and should be. And it absolutely has implications to the product, to who they target as customers who the competition is. Really who the competition is. And and specific typically to all the things that wrap around the actual product, like well expertise and service and customer success, those kinds of things that are part of, you know, what I call the whole solution.</p>



<p>You, you call it the whole solution too. I know you do. And and [00:15:00] that is the whole solution is what pragmatic buyers are looking for. Well, they&#8217;re not looking for another&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:15:05] tool like you, I studied at the altar of Jeffrey Moore as well, so I know the whole solution from the Documentum days and, and all of that, so.</p>



<p>Sure, sure. So we want to do a positioning project. We&#8217;re a company we want to engage with you. What does, how does a project work for you? How do you guide companies through this process?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Rene White: </strong>[00:15:25] Yeah, well, you know, no matter whether, you know, a company comes to me or somewhere else, they here&#8217;s what they should be looking for in this You know th the way you really started is first, you&#8217;ve got to have the company viewpoint.</p>



<p>So as your benchmark, right? So where do they think they are in terms of their place in the world? And then you got to go out and talk to real customers. And as I, as I talk to customers of my client I specifically and explicitly tell them talking to you and doing due diligence with customers, because I want to hear the unbiased [00:16:00] truth about what you really want and what you think you need.</p>



<p>Not the inherent bias of folks that are, you know, desperate to sell you something. Yeah. And then gap analysis. Because I think that&#8217;s important. What am I hearing about what the real, the real needs are and what customers lot lives in work? You know, roles are really about not, not their, not their job title, but you know, what their companies expect of them.</p>



<p>I do a little bit of inductive reasoning and versus deductive reasoning. So I don&#8217;t. Talk to customers and say, Oh, therefore, Tom, you know, the answer is I try to come up with what I think out of experience. Okay. In doing this, I think I&#8217;ve done 70 engagements over my time period. And then there&#8217;s a chasm group.</p>



<p>And, and try to come up with what I think is a hypothesis for what the positioning might look like. And then I play it with those customers. I talked to those end customers. I talked to you to get either validation or [00:17:00] oops, I got that wrong. And then I come back and present the ideas and recommendations, important ideas.</p>



<p>I like, like you said, I don&#8217;t try to come up with the answer and try to tell you that it is the answer. Because you guys know your business well enough. I&#8217;m a quick study. But you know, I can&#8217;t know things like the security marketplace or data curation or you know, those kinds of things better than the technologists and don&#8217;t presuppose to do it.</p>



<p>And I make recommendations on, you know you know, what the path is to take it. And maybe more importantly, you should always look to whomever you bring in from the outside to bring in best practices. So, where were other people gone before you and what can you learn from it so that you can one accelerate the process of coming up with the right positioning, the one that really stings and make something happen.</p>



<p>And then secondly of what landmines that you don&#8217;t need to [00:18:00] step on that sets you back. Because the last thing you want to do is start a positioning and realize two or three quarters into it that it&#8217;s wrong, that it really doesn&#8217;t differentiate you from your competitors. It doesn&#8217;t connect with customers in a way that says I prefer you over anybody else.</p>



<p>Yeah. So those are the kinds of things that, you know, go forward in making that and just helping the team. Cause these generally end with, you know, exec teams that are either listening in and, or it&#8217;s in some sort of workshop where we&#8217;re all talking about it. It&#8217;s the last part you should be looking for.</p>



<p>Someone from the outside to do is provoke your thinking. And help you kind of accelerate to the decision-making on what a great position you have to be. What happens&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:18:47] once you&#8217;ve done 70 of these? What happens when somebody violently disagrees with the position that you&#8217;ve come up with? Does that happen?</p>



<p><strong>Rene White: </strong>[00:18:57] You know, it&#8217;s almost, I can&#8217;t even think of a time [00:19:00] where there&#8217;s certainly not violent. There, there, there are always voices on exec staffs that believed that they know better. Hmm, and that they have the answer. And a lot of times it&#8217;s people who either talk to customers and like to talk in terms of anecdotes.</p>



<p>I talked to this one customer and they&#8217;d never say that or it comes from the technologists that are. Completely I want to say married to the value proposition that they originally created in can&#8217;t understand why the whole world doesn&#8217;t want to buy the way they articulate it comes from&nbsp;</p>



<p>bill&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:19:37] Gates to your point earlier.</p>



<p><strong>Rene White: </strong>[00:19:39] Yeah. You know, and for some people, you know, it&#8217;s really hard to argue with someone like a Steve jobs or a bill Gates, or, you know, an Elon Musk or, you know, come up with the latest sleeps. It&#8217;s hard. Believe me. And a lot of times, you know, they&#8217;re visionary and they&#8217;re right. And I learned a long time ago in dealing [00:20:00] with the likes of well, let&#8217;s see, not only Steve jobs, but Gordon Moore and Bob Noyce at Intel and Scott McNealy.</p>



<p>And that kind of can run down a bunch of the list of those days. And basically some, some of those people and I would put Steve and Steve definitely at the top that, that basically says these are rare people and you gotta let them run and then help them out. Most of the other crowd needs help.</p>



<p>And I think the other thing you learn when this is something that I think maybe for all your audience that are CMOs. Or marketing people or our work with CEOs on their positionings, especially as strong-willed, you know, people that are the ultimate decision makers on what the position should be.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s really important that you try not to be smarter than them and prove it to them. Careful. If you have an MBA from one of the blue chip schools, you have a tendency to want to do that. Or to basically just be a yes person and just, you know, you&#8217;re totally [00:21:00] right, because those kinds of people hate both those things.</p>



<p>So the you&#8217;re gonna, you&#8217;re going to ask me now. So what is the answer? What&#8217;s the way in basically it&#8217;s it&#8217;s to use the psychiatrist method and just basically ask why do you think that way? Or why do you think that will work? Ask it four times and really terrifically, brilliant people like. Steve jobs just wanted to be able to have someone, they could take their great ideas and work it through with them.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s all they really wanted to do because they knew they had the right hand&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:21:34] it&#8217;s it&#8217;s narrowing on. They had the right concept. It&#8217;s narrowing them on the right answer.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Rene White: </strong>[00:21:40] Yeah. And then helping them articulate it in a way that the marketplace would, you know, would consume it more easily. Then having crammed down the throat sometimes, which was as a tendency of, of brilliant entrepreneurs to cram their ideas down people&#8217;s throats.</p>



<p>And if they don&#8217;t like it, they can, you know, they can pound sand.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:21:59] How do you [00:22:00] measure the success? So you&#8217;ve gone through all this work. You&#8217;ve articulated it in this exact forum. You talked about how do you measure success and over what time period?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Rene White: </strong>[00:22:10] Yeah, yeah. As a marketing person, you know, you know, even though, you know marketing measurement has become, you know, more quantitative versus qualitative and there&#8217;s all kinds of ways to do, you know surveys and research and, you know, brand studies and things like that.</p>



<p>I have a really simple way to do this one. Is it. And this actually I think is actually a a bill Gates quote, you know great innovations. I&#8217;m going to, I&#8217;ve got a pair of wings, you know, great innovations, always take longer to take hold, but when they do, they&#8217;re more profound. So you know the real way I measure it and I, and I suggest my clients measured is do your ideal customers.</p>



<p>I use those words, very specific, your ideal customers, the center [00:23:00] point, you know of your customers, the ideal sweet spot of your customers. Do they understand your position and can they parrot that back to you? And do they prefer, and therefore, do they prefer you over competitors or even overdo nothing?</p>



<p>Yeah. Do you have a sense that your ideal customers, you get a pretty good, you know response to that? You know, the positioning is working. Note positioning is perfect. Positionings evolve over time with one caveat. And that is these anxious technology executives and entrepreneurs always are working at light speed.</p>



<p>So they think that their positioning should move just as quickly when in fact just win. You know, your CEO wants to change the positioning advanced the positioning. The customers are just getting the old one so careful that you don&#8217;t move too quickly on this. My&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:23:59] thought on that [00:24:00] is. It&#8217;s like when marketing gets gets bored of it, sales is just getting it when sales gets bored of that, customers are just getting it.</p>



<p>And when customers are getting bored of it is when you know, you know, you&#8217;ve done something,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Rene White: </strong>[00:24:11] right? Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. So careful on the quantitative stuff, it can be, it can be a trap.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:24:19] Yeah. Yeah. It turns out some of the, one of the lessons I learned, some of the best things you can do in marketing are impossible to measure in the way we want to.</p>



<p>We all, we want the world to be this direct response. Everything is perfect attribution. It&#8217;s just not how the real world works.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Rene White: </strong>[00:24:35] No, and I think, you know that my, you know, my, my other comment on this is, you know, it&#8217;s really the, the job, the role, I wouldn&#8217;t say job description, but it&#8217;s the role of the CMO to really help the CEO or the founders you know, with the vision of the company.</p>



<p>And where they&#8217;re taking them. And that&#8217;s so important. It&#8217;s not just get us a bunch of leads, Tom, and [00:25:00] it&#8217;s not just, you know, are we digitally marketing our way into fame? It, it really is. If, if, if you&#8217;re not helping well, here&#8217;s the thing I&#8217;ve seen CPOs be kind of switched themselves into this role.</p>



<p>Because they&#8217;re technical and they kind of understand the product. And I I kind of decry the fact that it&#8217;s harder and harder now for CMOs to play that vision role in that, which is positions, all part of that with, with the CEO about where we&#8217;re going, because I can tell you that when my operating days, that&#8217;s what I did.</p>



<p>I&#8217;d say, I&#8217;d say the marketing job, the marketing job was maybe 25% of my work. Most of my time was spent with the, with the exempt staff and certainly with two or three key individuals trying to understand where the vision of the company was going. Wow.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:25:54] That is not at all how CMOs operate today. And I think that&#8217;s, [00:26:00] it&#8217;s one of those, you know, I think we go back and look at.</p>



<p>How we did things in the past. Maybe that&#8217;s a change that we should think about re revisit.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Rene White: </strong>[00:26:08] Well, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s why you don&#8217;t see too many CMOs become CEOs.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:26:13] Indeed. Yeah. Topic of another episode, I coordinate with Dave Kellogg a few months ago. So Rene, this has been fantastic. Thank you so much for this short masterclass on positioning.</p>

<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:00:00] Yeah. It&#8217;s great to talk to you. So why don&#8217;t you just give yourself a quick introduction sure. </p>



<p><strong>Mike Waldrop: </strong>[00:00:03] So I&#8217;m currently DataStax I have worn a few different hats, but basically different flavors of pre-sales leadership.</p>



<p>One of the things about pre-sales everybody has a different title for it. So for some reason we call ourselves data architects instead of SES, but it&#8217;s the same idea. So yeah, pre-sales leadership. That&#8217;s kind of what I&#8217;ve been doing for quite a while. It&#8217;s what I like to do. It&#8217;s good stuff.</p>



<p>You were&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:00:26] my bosses boss like 20 years ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mike Waldrop: </strong>[00:00:29] I know, I know it seems like a long time ago. It was an unprecedented time then I guess it&#8217;s an unprecedented time now in a whole different way. Yeah, that was a long time ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:00:40] So what does a sales engineer actually do or sorry, whatever we call them. Solutions.</p>



<p>Consultant, sales, engineer, sales, data architect. What do you guys do? Yeah.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mike Waldrop: </strong>[00:00:51] So I I&#8217;ve talked about this before. I think the great thing about pre-sales it&#8217;s it&#8217;s right at the end intersection of lots of cool things. It&#8217;s right at the [00:01:00] intersection of the product, the customer, the market, and marketing, and message and direction.</p>



<p>You&#8217;re right in the middle of all of that. So when I think when it&#8217;s working well as a pre-sales person, you&#8217;re a bit of an industry expert. You&#8217;re a bit of a product expert. You&#8217;re a bit of a. How do businesses solve problems with technology yet? And then, you know, the dig the phrase because people use a lot that I believe are super important when you&#8217;re talking about it as like trusted advisor and that, that, that person that can make a connection in a relationship.</p>



<p>With a user or an at a company and help them figure out how to solve problems. Right. So I know that sounds kind of vague, but all of that, goodness, I think is why that&#8217;s, why I&#8217;ve always loved this role. I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve tried different roles, different parts of the organization. This is still what I love because you get to touch all of that different stuff.</p>



<p>Right. It&#8217;s right. Where it all comes together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[00:02:00] <strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:02:00] How do you get measured? Is it as an se? What do you get measured on? Yeah,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mike Waldrop: </strong>[00:02:05] so it, you know, different places it&#8217;s been different. You remember, you know, when we worked together, we had very tight pairing between SES and sales reps and territory.</p>



<p>So, you know, between an se and a sales rep, you kind of ran your own little enterprise within the organization. And then I, I love it. I&#8217;ve always loved it most when that was the case. And you could just be measured on revenue. Right. It&#8217;s revenue, it&#8217;s revenue, it&#8217;s revenue. World&#8217;s changed a bit. Models are different.</p>



<p>Customers are different. Expectations are a little bit different. So I still think revenue is, I mean, you&#8217;re usually part of the sales organization though. Lots of organizations these days have changed. Right? So you see presales more in the services line a little more often than we used to. So there is, you know, other things that you can measure people on that I think, you know, in my current role, it&#8217;s still primarily revenue based.</p>



<p>And you know, some levels of trying to measure. [00:03:00] You know, other contributions and you know, from from a comp plan, that&#8217;s usually revenue, but from a, is this a great se it&#8217;s usually similar fuzzy things that were a little hard to tie to a comp plan. Like, do they, do they make great relationships?</p>



<p>Are they proactive? Are they trusted advisors? You know, some of those things that are a little more fuzzy.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:03:19] You as, as an se and me as a marketer are measured on the same number revenue, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mike Waldrop: </strong>[00:03:24] Absolutely. Absolutely. And I think it&#8217;s really interesting. I&#8217;ve had some people that move from a services role, a consultant or whatever, and that change can be very different to them.</p>



<p>Right. They can feel Berry. Awkward about being measured on revenue. So but people that you know, that you and I worked with, and especially when we were doing it back then, it was people that love to be measured on revenue. It&#8217;s like the art of the deal, the, you know, going and doing that was really motivating.</p>



<p>But you know, in some companies now with a service-based company and things like that, it becomes a little bit more about [00:04:00] things beyond just pure revenue numbers. That, that define a really great se I think. I think that&#8217;s what&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:04:05] I like about the shift in marketing. I don&#8217;t remember this, but apparently back in the day, marketing would be measured on the quality of the trade show swag.</p>



<p>And you know, how many martinis you could have between four and six marketing now is very much mean for me, I&#8217;m measured on pipeline creation and ARR it&#8217;s very similar to how we used to think is individual contributor, STS. We were motivated by hitting our number and that was it. Yeah. I can imagine a model where you comp SES on demos or POV&#8217;s or whatever, not being aligned.</p>



<p>Revenue would be a problem for me, for sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mike Waldrop: </strong>[00:04:44] Yeah. And like I said, most of the behavior, like if I look at a team and I say, who are the rock stars and who are the all stars? You know, revenue is certainly an indicator. But there&#8217;s other things that I think are apparent when you&#8217;re subjectively you [00:05:00] know, meeting with a team or meeting with a person but sometimes hard to measure.</p>



<p>But you know, I think, I think given a lot of the changes in the industry, the changes in the market, the changes in the world lately, I know in my current role, we&#8217;re a lot more focused on trying to be. You know, externally focused and outside in like what what enterprises need, what, what are they trying to do?</p>



<p>And trying to really calibrate the SES to be like, you know, worry about that problem and the revenue will come.&nbsp; So I think it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s definitely harder to measure, but it&#8217;s, it creates a much better interaction model. Well,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:05:38] I think, and I want to talk to you about how SES and marketers work together with the other big change.</p>



<p>You know, one of the reasons why I was a good se is because&nbsp; I would do whatever it takes to sell software. And that meant the demo or presentation I had to give only had to ever be used. Once the consulting team would scream at me after [00:06:00] they saw it , our product doesn&#8217;t do what Wentworth just showed.</p>



<p>Yeah, but in that era and the perpetual software era, it didn&#8217;t matter. My job was to sell it as somebody else&#8217;s job to worry about the rest. And at the time I was celebrated for being able to do that. And that&#8217;s why shelfware was such a big deal. But now as, as an se, can&#8217;t do you can&#8217;t get away with that anymore?</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t. Do you any good if that deal churns, 12 months later?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mike Waldrop: </strong>[00:06:26] Yeah. Yeah. My, my current company, we&#8217;re very much a platform kind of sell and it. It&#8217;s all about land and expand anyway. So even if it was a different model, unless I get the expansion, I&#8217;m not going to win anyway. So if you&#8217;re selling capacity or you&#8217;re selling transactions or you&#8217;re selling something that&#8217;s land and expand, it&#8217;s even harder.</p>



<p>Like, as you said, you know, not only ARR based that they get to. We used to say in a previous company, every year&#8217;s an election year, a customer can cancel the contract whenever they want. But it&#8217;s also like, how do I get [00:07:00] growth? How do I get more consumption? How do I get them to be more successful?</p>



<p>And, you know, we talked about now an enterprise that it starts with a project and then they go to a program and then they get to a platform and all that. So, you know, that message, that marketing message that you take. As an se to your enterprise has to reflect that. And that can be tricky, but you know, to your point about demos and things like that, I do think.</p>



<p>Gosh in my world today, I had somebody asked me, they just started. They&#8217;re like, w where are the standard demos? And I&#8217;m like, what standard demos? I don&#8217;t know what that is. That doesn&#8217;t really exist. And the product that I&#8217;m working with now is sold on the whiteboard. Right. So, yeah, I need enough message to get the conversation.</p>



<p>I need enough message to get somebody to show up and listen to me. And that&#8217;s really the message that matters. Once you get past that, it&#8217;s going to happen on the whiteboard anyway.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:07:52] All right. Let&#8217;s dig into that. Cause that&#8217;s really well on focus today, by the way, and expand, my model was land in shelfware land and shit.</p>



<p>[00:08:00] All right. So I&#8217;m, you know, I&#8217;m a marketer and I know better. My job is to tell you what to go do. Mr. Waldrip, I put this great pitch deck together. Why are you delivering? And you&#8217;re on this whiteboard. Why aren&#8217;t you delivering my pitch deck? Yeah, I&#8217;ve got the story nailed. I&#8217;ve rehearsed it. It&#8217;s amazing.</p>



<p>I built it myself. Why are you not out there giving my story?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mike Waldrop: </strong>[00:08:28] Yeah. More times than not. By the time an se shows up we&#8217;re beyond the level of this thing might do something for me. They usually want to know how will it do it. Right. So the perfect message usually gets me the why should I listen, but not the, how do I.</p>



<p>Get those benefits you talked about. So I&#8217;m all for alignment on the the context of the message, but in my opinion, there&#8217;s never been a perfect slide deck. [00:09:00] And. In today&#8217;s world, the attention span of somebody to sit there and look at a sequence of slides is very minimal. So I need something to grab the attention and something to get started.</p>



<p>That message. And then the themes have to be aligned whether or not you gave me the themes in a slide deck, or we had an hour long conversation. And you told me as a marketer, Hey, you know, the themes that are going to differentiate us are these three things. And, you know, here&#8217;s the customers that prove that and whatever.</p>



<p>Getting that into my head is super important, but whether I use your slide or use a conversation or a whiteboard either, there&#8217;s lots of ways to get that message across. That&#8217;s really&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:09:41] important for all the marketers out there to hear. So, as an se, what do you, how do you describe marketing? I already asked you what&#8217;s marketing.</p>



<p>Do, what do you say? Yeah.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mike Waldrop: </strong>[00:09:50] So as I said before, it certainly when you think of the. That if I&#8217;m going to call somebody and they don&#8217;t know who I am, I&#8217;m not going to get to the cool part of the conversation [00:10:00] where I can convince them. So they, they need to know who I am. You know, why I&#8217;m calling? What, what, what we&#8217;re talking about, why it matters.</p>



<p>Does, do I have some justification for my point of view? Right? So one of the things we train at on is it&#8217;s great to have a point of view and you did this great all the time. Right? You can show up with a point of view. Hey, Mr. Customer, this is what you should do, but in order for that to mean anything, I got to have some legitimacy, some work, you know, some reputation as a company that, Oh, this guy&#8217;s not just one guy that sort of thinks about it.</p>



<p>So there needs to be a message out there. It needs to capture that attention. So marketing helps me do that, especially on the brand and, and, and kind of, you know, company marketing side. And then, you know, from a product marketing perspective. You know, they put tools in my toolbox and I need those, right.</p>



<p>They put messages, they put competitive info, they put, you know customer stories references, all that stuff. [00:11:00] They put all that in my tool bag. And I, and I&#8217;m going to have a hard time if I don&#8217;t have some of that. What are your&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:11:05] favorite tools like? What&#8217;s the, what do you like best and talking about product marketing specifically.</p>



<p>What do you like best that you get from product marketing?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mike Waldrop: </strong>[00:11:14] If I got nothing else out of product marketing, I mean, there&#8217;s lots of things that I like to get, but if I could only have one thing, it would be customer stories that I can tell. If I can tell customer stories and they&#8217;re compelling, they have a point.</p>



<p>They ideally even have some numbers behind it or whatever. But if I got nothing else, other than that, I&#8217;d feel pretty good. Right? So number one for me is when I&#8217;m standing there, last thing people want to hear a speeds and feeds from me. So product marketing is going to help me ground that in stories of customers that I might not have worked with.</p>



<p>I mean, that&#8217;s super critical. And it&#8217;s gotta be more than just, Hey, you know, customer X bought the product and, and loves it. It&#8217;s gotta be [00:12:00] some meat, right. ROI,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:12:01] real defensible manager, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mike Waldrop: </strong>[00:12:04] Yeah. Yeah. And the stories, and I know this is probably part of the conversation, but. The people that go to product marketing that usually deliver the best tools for me, did what I do.</p>



<p>And so they know my world. Don&#8217;t&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:12:19] skip ahead.</p>



<p>If your favorite is case studies, what&#8217;s the part of marketers are busy. They got lots of things they got to do. What&#8217;s the thing that they can stop giving you and you wouldn&#8217;t care.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mike Waldrop: </strong>[00:12:35] The for product marketing. Ah, it&#8217;s a good question. I don&#8217;t know. I mean, you know, We don&#8217;t do trade shows anymore. So all that&#8217;s pretty much disappeared anyway. So you know, that whole thing of here&#8217;s the here&#8217;s, all of that stuff doesn&#8217;t really matter that much. Sometimes having a favorable Gartner view is helpful, depends on product and market.</p>



<p>And so [00:13:00] that&#8217;s still pretty important. But&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:13:02] the, they don&#8217;t need to give you a pitch stack. They need to give you a whiteboard marker.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mike Waldrop: </strong>[00:13:07] Yeah, they need to give me the message. And they need to give. Well me, not me, but through whatever you&#8217;re using to do BDRs or whatever you call them to go get those first calls going.</p>



<p>I need the, I need the opportunities to do my thing. Right. So I, I, yeah, I do need the leads if you will, or the opportunities generated. But. You know, that&#8217;s kind of a different piece of it, I guess, if that answers the question, but&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:13:35] you were saying case studies and value based metrics are the thing that you use the most and all the other, all the other sales tools we produce are good.</p>



<p>You want more&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mike Waldrop: </strong>[00:13:45] case studies? Yeah, generally that&#8217;s been my experience. Now again, it depends on the product. Now. There are some products where having a easily executed. Demo that really captures the imagination can be [00:14:00] super important. So I don&#8217;t want to diminish the value of that. I think that&#8217;s a little bit unique too, when you&#8217;re in a platform I&#8217;m selling a database now there&#8217;s not a database demo that anybody&#8217;s ever seen that got them excited.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s, you know, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s technically impossible to make that exciting, but you know, some other cases where a demo is going to be super important. One of the things we did when, when you and I worked together, that I thought really worked well, were. Really short multiple the media content that just deliver a message.</p>



<p>Yeah. Right. Not a demo, but a here&#8217;s a value point. Here&#8217;s a capability that you should care about. And it&#8217;s gotta be like, literally something that I can put in a link to an email and somebody don&#8217;t look at it and go, Oh, I want to have a conversation. Right. I think those kinds of things are really, can be really very, very powerful.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:14:48] I have this hypothesis that marketing teams and SES don&#8217;t work as closely together as they should. From your perspective, how do you think marketing could work better [00:15:00] with the se organizations that you&#8217;ve worked with and you&#8217;ve led.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mike Waldrop: </strong>[00:15:04] Well, so one thing about SCS is we have huge egos.</p>



<p>So this is my ego speaking, but the first thing I would say is listen to my point of view when you&#8217;re putting the message together, right? SES are on the ground. They&#8217;re having the conversations every day and while marketers that are looking at the market and that the top level have a point of view.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s super important. The ground game that I&#8217;m participating in every day is going to add either color or context or correction to whatever it is that they&#8217;re trying to bring from the top. So when marketing wants to hear or wants to try something out, it&#8217;s like, what do you think about this? I think we end up with a better product and a message and or whatever.</p>



<p>So. Yeah, how do we work best together? Certainly when I feel like I&#8217;m part of helping contribute to the message [00:16:00] and you know, I love to have marketing people that want to have customer context, right? So if, if they want to meet with, and show up on meetings with customers, I think that&#8217;s great.</p>



<p>They&#8217;ve done right. It isn&#8217;t the right spot and it&#8217;s the right conversation. Because I do like to, I think one of our jobs as SES is to add the reality of the marketing message, but from getting the feedback from us, putting it in front of customers, that kind of thing. So I think all of those things make it better.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:16:33] What is it? So if you want a product marketer, so you&#8217;re open to having product marketers or marketers in general, joining you on sales calls, but it&#8217;s great. That&#8217;s one of the things I encourage my team at recorded future to do is there&#8217;s no better trial. It&#8217;s easy to build a message, in Google slides, it&#8217;s easy to deliver a message to your peers.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s even easy to deliver a message to. The sales leaders. It&#8217;s really hard to deliver a message [00:17:00] live in front of people that you could look at, read their body language, hear their questions, see the message miss and just go over them. So it&#8217;s scary, but I think it&#8217;s so important. What advice would you give a product marketer who wanted to, to get out there and start doing this in front of customers?</p>



<p><strong>Mike Waldrop: </strong>[00:17:20] Figure out don&#8217;t don&#8217;t feel too precious about the exact message in slide, right? So it goes back to the whiteboard conversation or whatever, you know, if you&#8217;re going to deliver content as a marketer, to a customer, that&#8217;s great deliver it. But if it prompts a conversation, that&#8217;s way more important than your slides.</p>



<p>Right. So I have this with sales reps sometimes and other people they&#8217;re like, I got to get my message. I got to get through the slides. And like, I don&#8217;t care if you get through the slides, if your first slide started the right conversation, we&#8217;re good. Like, let, let the conversation go. So I think it&#8217;s those dynamics.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re not doing a lot of customer meetings, then that, that can be new to a marketing [00:18:00] person. And don&#8217;t get defensive. Yeah. It&#8217;s a great right. You and I do this, have done this enough in the past where you can get beat up in a meeting and that can be okay. That&#8217;s not the end. That doesn&#8217;t mean things are bad.</p>



<p>Somebody starts poking at you and, and interrogating your message or your story or your demo or your product. That&#8217;s not always bad. It can be painful, but if you&#8217;re not used to it, it can feel really bad.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:18:29] It&#8217;s hard. There&#8217;s two lessons. I mean, first of all, I was always accused before I even worked with you.</p>



<p>The one thing somebody told me once is don&#8217;t talk&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mike Waldrop: </strong>[00:18:37] past the sale.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:18:39] Yeah. So I was this guy that would get so excited about my product that even though the customer had clearly bought off on whatever I was trying to say, but no, no, no, wait a minute. We didn&#8217;t go over here yet. Like there&#8217;s more, don&#8217;t talk past the sale.</p>



<p>&nbsp;So that was sort of number one. But number two is I&#8217;ve been in meetings. I&#8217;m sure you have where. It&#8217;s very clear. The person in the room doesn&#8217;t know [00:19:00] what they&#8217;re talking about, but yet the rep or the se, or both want to be the smartest person in the room. I&#8217;ve learned that you want to be the dumbest person in the room.</p>



<p>In some ways you want to be as smart as you need to be to get them to say yes,&nbsp; I remember being in situations where&nbsp; their understanding of something I was talking about and it would be 75%.</p>



<p>Correct. And I&#8217;d be like, no, that&#8217;s exactly right. You got it. You&#8217;re on it.&nbsp; I learned a lesson. It doesn&#8217;t you don&#8217;t need to get to a hundred percent, but often marketers again, you know, we, we hang on so much, but no, my, no, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re not quite getting it. Let me, let me focus you here.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mike Waldrop: </strong>[00:19:36] Yeah. Yeah.</p>



<p>Yeah. And that&#8217;s a great point. And I think it&#8217;s also that same motion that makes you want to try to close the whole deal in the meeting when all you&#8217;re really trying to do is get to the next conversation, the next level, the next, you know, unless it&#8217;s a closing meeting, which is unusual, but, you know, Hey, I don&#8217;t have to tell, I don&#8217;t have to convince them of everything.</p>



<p>I got to convince them. They need to take the next step. And then. You know, [00:20:00] all the cliches around people buy from people. They trust people buy from people. They&#8217;re not buying a product of Brian and peaceful, you know, all that stuff applies here as well. Right. So if you&#8217;re a marketer in a meeting, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re not just selling the message you&#8217;re selling the company and the expertise and the all that.</p>



<p>And and part of that is listening when they start talking because How many meetings have you been in where it just gets broadcast only and everybody&#8217;s asleep. You know, nobody wants to just see a broadcast of a set of slides.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:20:28] Yeah, I think on a related point, I think if I were in sales now I&#8217;d be miserable.</p>



<p>I&#8217;d be terrible at it. I am not a good zoom presenter. My, my, whatever it is, does not work as well. It&#8217;s hard miss the whole part of being able to fly around the country and present and all of that. You know, I think that&#8217;s part I miss greatly and you know, maybe someday that will come back.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mike Waldrop: </strong>[00:20:52] Yeah. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s really hard.</p>



<p>And although I&#8217;ve been surprised that more things got done than I thought remotely, but it&#8217;s still hard when you&#8217;re not, [00:21:00] you know, Cause you know, the best parts of the meeting usually usually happen in the hallway before you walk in or on the way out when somebody is like, yeah, that guy&#8217;s a real jerk and I know, you know, or whatever, but yeah.</p>



<p>So last&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:21:12] question for you. So you&#8217;ve been a career, you&#8217;ve been a career se and as you&#8217;re sorta, it&#8217;s one of the rare, you&#8217;re one of the rare career SES that I know. And I want to know a little bit the path because my path into marketing came through being an se. I think it&#8217;s something. If, if I were a junior se and I were listening to this podcast, I&#8217;d be thinking about, you know, my path and where I can go.</p>



<p>Like what&#8217;s. How do you describe the career path for the SES that you bring up?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mike Waldrop: </strong>[00:21:40] Yeah. So it&#8217;s always a tough conversation because a lot of times I get a lot of essays that are frustrated that there&#8217;s not a well charted course. Like what is the course? What do I do first? What comes after that? And then what&#8217;s next.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s very, it&#8217;s very, it&#8217;s quite varied depending on what you want to do. [00:22:00] So yeah. And I&#8217;ve done, I&#8217;ve done a little bit of product management. I&#8217;ve done a little bit of other things enough to know that this is where I really want to be. But what I usually try to do is say, don&#8217;t tell me the job you want to do.</p>



<p>Tell me what kinds of. Activities and, and satisfaction you get out of the different things that happen. Like, do you get satisfaction from customer interaction, then you want to stay down a path that puts you in front of customers more. If you get satisfaction out of the technology, that&#8217;s a different tab.</p>



<p>If you get, you know, if you&#8217;re intrigued by, you know making a better mouse trap. I think the people that I see that do really well, going down the marketing path are the ones that really enjoy putting together the vision and elevating it. Right. So how do I, how do I take all of these 10 things that I know and put it into three sentences that cover all that.</p>



<p>And some people are really good at it. I I&#8217;ve had a lot of people that have gone down a product marketing path. That&#8217;s usually a very commonplace because. [00:23:00] That technical expertise is so useful. And, and you, and a few others that have gone down even even other marketing paths, which I think is very cool.</p>



<p>So yeah, I usually, you know, when the career path conversation comes up, what are the things about being an se that you like? Are you really just trying to get more money and more seniority, or do you want to do different activities and then try to use that to find a path. Right. Do you want to be a product expert?</p>



<p>You know, there&#8217;s usually some technical path that, you know, more product expertise. I want to be the biggest and baddest and best is that some technical piece of it? Or do you want to do people leadership? Right. So that&#8217;s the most common career path challenge I&#8217;ve seen in the se ranks is people assuming the next step is people leadership.</p>



<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So that&#8217;s the presumption is if I want to move forward, I need to get an se manager job, or I need to get a, whatever&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:23:56] to be. So&nbsp; I worked for you and then you [00:24:00] moved on and I ended up leading the team that you had managed. At one point, I hated being an se manager, dealing with the reps who would ask.</p>



<p>I want this person, not this person all those management and all the SES wanting, when am I going to become a principal?&nbsp; It&#8217;s one of the reasons why I got into marketing because that path to me was,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mike Waldrop: </strong>[00:24:22] yeah.</p>



<p>Yeah. It&#8217;s people assume that they&#8217;re going to like it because it&#8217;s higher up the chain. But again, that goes back to. Hey, what is it that you like to do? Let me explain to you what I know about those roles. Like, you know, remember, especially when you and I worked together, there was this. We worked with a lot of sales reps that made a lot of money.</p>



<p>People are like, Oh, I want to go do that. Like they don&#8217;t, they don&#8217;t have to build a demo and they get a nice big fat check and it was easy to ignore, like the pressure, the, you know, so I always tell SCS I&#8217;m like, are you willing? To get beat up for something you had very little control over. If you&#8217;re a customer and gets hit by a bus the day before [00:25:00] closing, nobody says, well, you did a great job right up until the end, and then you didn&#8217;t get the deal.</p>



<p>Right. So it&#8217;s like that reality of that&#8217;s the sales rep life. And some people love it and do great at it. And you know, those kinds of things, but yeah, people management is I think the, the parts that people don&#8217;t see, like if I&#8217;m a good se manager, And you&#8217;re on my team. You don&#8217;t see the ugly parts.</p>



<p>Yeah,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:25:23] well, that&#8217;s, we&#8217;ve got a great one at recorded future and his job is to manage the metrics and it&#8217;s it&#8217;s, it is crazy how much more metrics there are now. I don&#8217;t remember what my POV close rate was or any of the things that I think now we can measure at a much more granular level than we could ever do before.</p>



<p><strong>Mike Waldrop: </strong>[00:25:42] Yeah. Data-driven, it&#8217;s data-driven is tough, but we, we face that where I am now. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s tough to measure. SES purely on data, but it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a, where did they go for sure. But it&#8217;s tricky. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:25:55] Well, as we wrap this up, the data, I think you and I can both agree on as a marketer, as an [00:26:00] se, that matters is, is revenue.</p>



<p>And I feel the same way, and I felt the same way as an se, when I would lose. I remember the losses more than I remember the wins. Yeah. I can still go back and think of the deals that I&#8217;ve lost. Because they are, they were heartbreak. I can&#8217;t remember the deals I won except for the first one, but I can remember&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mike Waldrop: </strong>[00:26:19] most of the bosses.</p>



<p>Yeah. Yeah, definitely. And I think, you know, everything is good when revenue is flowing. Right. There&#8217;s no you know, there&#8217;s nothing bad about that, for sure. So and then, you know, I&#8217;ve always found it interesting that it&#8217;s part of the interview process. I usually ask people about. About that? Like, how do you, how do you feel about accelerators and how do you feel about stuff like that?</p>



<p>Is that something that even crosses your mind? And if it does, then they&#8217;re usually pretty sales oriented.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:26:47] Thanks for your time today. Really appreciate it. Great perspective on the sales engineer, marketing relationship</p>

<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:00:00] Hey Mercedes, how are you? I&#8217;m good, Tom. How are you? It&#8217;s great to talk to you.</p>



<p>You actually placed me at Recorded Future a little over a year ago.</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:00:10] Yep. Fantastic.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:00:12] Can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s been that long time flies.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:00:15] Yeah.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:00:16] Did you know when you first reached out to me? I went and looked at all the times that we&#8217;ve communicated over the years. Any idea when you first reach out to me and what it was for.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:00:28] I didn&#8217;t until you sent me a note and I saw it and it was actually an Insight portfolio company.</p>



<p>So it was one of my first projects with insight for the company jet arts.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:00:38] Yeah, exactly.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:00:39] Yeah. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:00:40] For CEO search, I was, I should have been more flattered than I think I was, I was clearly not a fit for that, but, and gen arts is a really cool company. I didn&#8217;t really know.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:00:51] Yeah. And it was Really interesting tech.</p>



<p>They were open to somebody who was go to market and particularly [00:01:00] product marketing messaging positioning, because they felt that they really had a go to market issue versus a tech product market fit issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:01:11] Really rare for, I was talking to Dave Kellogg, who you and I both know about. He&#8217;s one of the few marketers who successfully transitioned into becoming a CEO.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a really difficult transition for, for CMOs to make&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:01:25] it is though, a couple of people, Jen grant recently became a CMI CEO. And there it is, it is typically though a tougher transition than. You know, chief product officer or obviously chief operating officer. I think traditionally a lot of Valley companies have looked at CRS though.</p>



<p>I think in PGG companies, that&#8217;s a mistake. But yeah, the CMO role has not been as much of a feeder to the CEO spot as some of the others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[00:02:00] <strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:02:01] Yeah, not at all. But I remember when I looked at all the times, you&#8217;re from which we&#8217;ll talk about in a second, Reached out to me, they were all really great opportunities.</p>



<p>The track record of, of the opportunities that either you or your firm brought in front of me were really, really great. So tell me a little bit about the, about Caldwell, what you do and what you focus.</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:02:21] Sure. So as a firm we focus pretty much on. C-level work. So CMIO CTO CRO functional roles that report to the CEO. I personally run our VC and private equity practice. So I work fairly exclusively with venture backed companies, private equity, backed companies primarily looking for folks to.</p>



<p>Run product, run, marketing run, go to market as well. So CRS as well. And then, and then on the flip side of that, I do a lot of work with the firms themselves. So I do, I put [00:03:00] partners into many of the brand name VC firms, as well as operating partners into private equity firms and some partners into private equity.</p>



<p>So that&#8217;s that&#8217;s me. And before Caldwell, I&#8217;ve been at Caldwell for about, well, over 10 and a half years. And before that ran the same thing, the venture capital practice for Heidrick and struggles, which is a very large global firm.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:03:22] Yeah.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:03:23] And I think that&#8217;s actually, when we first, I think I was at Heidrick.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:03:26] You were a long time ago. What&#8217;s this cool about LinkedIn? If you go back and everything is there, I was surprised at how much. You can go back and see all the, all the mat, all the sort of messages. It&#8217;s a little scary too. I should probably go and make sure I purged some of those.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:03:43] Yeah.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:03:45] You do a lot of work for insight partners who is, you know, recorded future is a partner with, how did you get?</p>



<p>And I think by a lot of work, you do all almost all of their, their executive recruiting or a big chunk of it. How did that relationship come about?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:03:59] Yeah. [00:04:00] So I started with working with insight insight. When I started working with them was much more of a New York centric firms or the East coast centric firms.</p>



<p>Do they invest all over the world all over the country? Certainly. As well, I got introduced to them primarily through other VCs with whom I worked. I&#8217;ve done a lot of work over the years with gray lock. I&#8217;ve done quite a bit of work. With other firms here, you know, Sequoia and Lightspeed and others.</p>



<p>And I got introduced to insight through several of those relationships and started to work with them. Up and down the East coast and in their portfolio with companies like gen arts. And that led me to, to really specializing with them. They tend to like to work with recruiters, to do who are deep subject matter experts in one area or another, so that it&#8217;s sort of a product market fit with their portfolio.</p>



<p>So with insight, I&#8217;ve done. A lot of their chief marketing officer work, a big chunk of it. And [00:05:00] these tend to be companies that are, you know, somewhere beyond 20 30 million in revenue. They&#8217;re either looking to go from. Single product to platform and into the hands of some, to the hands of many, or from Europe into North America for the first time companies like Showpad and lean IIX and checkout and others that I&#8217;ve worked with, but that the has really been built on.</p>



<p>A great partnership, consistent work across their portfolio and bringing to bear folks like you put CMOs and CPOs into a lot of their companies that have had big liquidity events solar winds and floral side, and many others turn it in. A lot of their companies get acquired quite a creatively as well as go public.</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s been a. It&#8217;s been a really good relationship.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:05:58] Yeah. Pluralsight had a pretty [00:06:00] big event this week, I think. Right?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:06:01] Yeah. I think if you&#8217;re, if your company&#8217;s named anything site this last week, you were on the target list. So plural site Gainsight. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:06:12] I just both Vista.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:06:14] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So those are great outcomes for two wonderful founders.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:06:20] Yeah. And insight has a pretty spectacular track record too. So that&#8217;s that helps.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:06:25] Yeah. They have a wonderful track record. They are, they invest in great companies. They really bring to bear. You&#8217;re part of the thing that&#8217;s interesting about working with them is they are so invested in building out the.</p>



<p>The scalability of these companies with operational excellence. So they have a marketing center of excellence is I think, you know, I think you interviewed with Gary service when we were talking about,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:06:46] we&#8217;ll talk about that in a second. That&#8217;s my one of my next topic.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:06:49] Yep. Good, good,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:06:50] good. We&#8217;ll start there.</p>



<p>It was the hardest interview I&#8217;ve had in my career. So I enjoyed the process for being hired at recorded future. I talked to you, I talked to Christopher, the [00:07:00] CEO and some exact team members. And when I got to insight. Very clearly they have an interviewing methodology and an approach to it. And it was really difficult.</p>



<p>It was a challenging, I met with a few people there, including Gary and they drill in that, you know, to they double click at a level that most interviewers don&#8217;t. Tell me about this. Well, how did you deal with this? Well, tell me that more to the point where you get down to the exact tactic. It&#8217;s a really interesting, and it was, it was great.</p>



<p>And I have a lot of respect for them for doing that, but it was by far. The most thorough interviewing process that I think I&#8217;ve ever had in coming to join a company.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:07:38] Yeah. I mean, they&#8217;re there. So they, part of their big differentiation is that they really can help these companies. Through operational excellence and through improving their operations, their go to market functions, their product organizations.</p>



<p>And so those subject matter experts live [00:08:00] at insight. And, and so before they deploy them into the field or before they find people like you to help the companies to succeed. So in order to make sure that you&#8217;re going to be successful and the company is going to be successful, they. I want to have these competency-based interviews with their subject matter expert and Gary service is that for insight on the marketing side, I actually just hired their product center of excellence lead, and that is Ryan Polk.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s amazing. And I can only imagine he&#8217;s having interviews like that right now. Future chief product officers. Yeah, they, they drill down on it&#8217;s it goes well beyond the. You know, tell me what you did and what you found too, you know, what&#8217;s the marketing tech stack and what are the OKR? Is you, you track?</p>



<p>Who did you, you know, who owned those OKR cars? I mean, they&#8217;re very, very detail oriented.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:08:55] I did great. I think on all of those questions where Gary and I got into it a [00:09:00] little bit, and it was a really interesting question. It&#8217;s. Know, you&#8217;re in marketing, talk about salespeople and what motivates them. And I used to be in sales a bit.</p>



<p>And what motivated me was winning a deal. I love the feeling of winning a deal and being an se. And knowing that I beat the competition, motivated me. I thought that C and I said, it&#8217;s, coin-operated salespeople are in sales to make lots of money. You know, they often do their pricing strategy by looking at.</p>



<p>Their mortgage payment and to make my mortgage payment, when I reverse engineer up to how much the deal is going to cost. But so I, so Gary and I, he said, well, you&#8217;re missing something, Tom I&#8217;m okay. I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m missing, I&#8217;m missing. And I eventually got to it, which was recognition. Which I thought was really important.</p>



<p>And he, you know, he, he, he got me there eventually, but I thought I was miserably going to fail our interview over that topic and eventually dragged it out of me.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:09:54] Yeah. Yeah, no, they have a really thorough process and, you know, they, we we get to see [00:10:00] the stats on the other side of this and they have like a seven point process they run and when their portfolio companies.</p>



<p>Take on all seven points. The likelihood of the hire being successful is over 90% and it drops with the inability to execute on one of those points. And I&#8217;d say the other thing with them too, is that there. This may sound heavy handed. But when I talked to the portfolio companies, CEOs, and executives, it doesn&#8217;t feel heavy handed.</p>



<p>It feels like a really good and get, you know interactive process. So it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, I think it&#8217;s, it is a big differentiator for them and it&#8217;s a huge value for the portfolio.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:10:45] It&#8217;s something that private equity companies do really well that standalone startups, don&#8217;t private equity companies. Understand the importance of placing executives and the long-term impact of doing it poorly, where people like [00:11:00] insight and Vista and others just have made it into a formula and about the data.</p>



<p>It also, I assume helps you because, you know, as an executive recruiter, the kinds of attributes that will make candidates successful well to that thought process.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:11:12] Yep. No, it&#8217;s super helpful. That&#8217;s one of the reasons I love working with them. So&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:11:17] let&#8217;s talk about marketing leaders specifically. So you do a lot of placement of VPs and CMOs.</p>



<p>So how do you, like, how do you know, what do you look for? Like, how do you, when you start, you have a pool of people on a universe of people, where do you first start your focus? Does it start? Does the process start by? Obviously I assume that the founder CEO gives you some profile. Is that how it&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:11:39] starts?</p>



<p>So. It is driven by what the company needs and it&#8217;s driven by what the CEO can articulate around what those needs are. So if she needs somebody who, you know, is. Incredibly strong [00:12:00] around storytelling messaging positioning, because they don&#8217;t yet have a cohesive brand in the market. Then that&#8217;s going to be one area we&#8217;re going to build into scorecard.</p>



<p>So essentially we developed a scorecard with the CEO and that scorecard should really cover. It&#8217;s like when you go, how shopping and you&#8217;re thinking about, you know, the first thing you want to pick is where do you want to live geographically? The second thing is. You know, what, what&#8217;s the neighborhood within that geography?</p>



<p>The third thing might be, do you want a one story home or a two story home, but you have to set those guidelines really early on and then get into the search directed by those guidelines. So it really does come down to the, you know, what are the, what are the. What are the core qualifications that they&#8217;re looking for?</p>



<p>What is, what is the first-year success? What does the second year success look like? What are those success factors? And then we build the scorecard around that core criteria and the success factors. And part of it is really drilling down with the CTO [00:13:00] around not just what they think they need. But what.</p>



<p>The needs, what are the holes within the organization? So what is the current team look like? What are the strengths of the team? How do you build diversity into that team? So that, that&#8217;s how you think about getting into the market. And it really does behoove a company. And a process to go a little bit slower in the beginning to make sure you have all those guide rails set up so that then you can go fast.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s that old adage about go slow to go fast. And when you skip that step, it is inevitably a shit show in like you there&#8217;s, you have to have a directed. Data-driven search and you have to tear yourself up with the right direction to get the right feeds. And in terms of data, Is there anything&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:13:52] specific to the scorecard for marketers that stands out as being different from other executives?</p>



<p>You feel obviously marketers, [00:14:00] there&#8217;s this old adage that we have this shortest time of anyone in the C suite and, you know, marketers lose their job.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:14:07] He says might have the shortest time of anyone in the C-suite right now. Fat&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:14:11] too. Chatty. Fair enough. Is there anything, what makes, what makes marketing in particular more difficult to recruit for?</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:14:19] Yeah, I think part of the challenge is that. Companies don&#8217;t understand what marketing can or can&#8217;t do. And so often marketing becomes this catch all for, you know, we can&#8217;t find product market fit, so let&#8217;s hire a marketer to come in and market us so that product so that the market finds us. And that&#8217;s not something marketing can solve for.</p>



<p>So what can marketing solve for if you have. Good. If you have great technology or good, good to great technology, and you have product market fit with that technology, and you know who you&#8217;re going to sell to [00:15:00] then marketing can absolutely help you with the messaging and the positioning and the seeding of the market.</p>



<p>So that you&#8217;re. Sales organization. If you&#8217;re an enterprise driven sales organization can shorten up the sales cycle and sell more efficiently and effectively. So, you know, the first thing is really defining what, what it is that you want of marketing and then making sure that maps to what marketing can actually do.</p>



<p>And so generally the attributes that we&#8217;re looking for, I&#8217;d say particularly over the last year have, have been around. Product driven growth. So how does marketing product marketing in particular has become just a huge hugely desired skillset and a needed skillset in a CMO. And as you know, it&#8217;s not that.</p>



<p>CMOs should be strong enough across all the marketing functions from demand generation messaging and positioning corporate marketing field marketing, product marketing to [00:16:00] be dangerous, quote unquote, but I&#8217;ve seen a huge emphasis over the last year on product marketing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:16:05] Yeah. Dave Kellogg again, made a great point.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s three, three main attributes, right? Demand gen. Brand comms, product marketing, and you can only realistically be great at two of those. And I think that&#8217;s the CEO&#8217;s who look for somebody who&#8217;s this magical unicorn who&#8217;s going to solve every one of those. That&#8217;s not a realistic role of a view of a CMO.</p>



<p>You can certainly hire for that. I think in particular, I was a product marketer with. Product marketer slash demand generator. And that just meant I had to make sure it recorded future that we had great comms and PR people and we do&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:16:41] totally, totally. And that is the big thing. I think when you go looking for a COO or any senior executive, and again, it goes again, it goes back to the scorecard.</p>



<p>What is the critical, if you&#8217;ve got five criteria. And you&#8217;re going to weight each criteria to add up to a hundred what&#8217;s the criteria are going to give [00:17:00] 20, and then you divide the other four up. You divide the other four vectors across that, or what&#8217;s the one you&#8217;re going to give 25 or even 30, usually not more than 40.</p>



<p>But what, what are you going to give the most weight to? And that&#8217;s where your person&#8217;s going to spike really, really high. And then just make sure that that is a realistic. Attribute of a CMO. I mean, I do think sometimes people want this combination of incredibly data-driven lead generation they&#8217;ll want somebody who&#8217;s grown up in demand generation lead generation, creating demand organic growth.</p>



<p>And then they&#8217;ll also want somebody who is really strong in product and not understand that product management is separate from product marketing. So they&#8217;re, they&#8217;re things you can&#8217;t get together in one body and things you can. But again, to me, it comes back to being really clear [00:18:00] at the onset as to what hole you&#8217;re trying to fill and making sure it&#8217;s a hole that marketing can fill.</p>



<p>Is&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:18:07] that something you find you have to teach CEO&#8217;s or do they know that coming into the hiring process?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:18:13] Generally, I don&#8217;t have to teach the AMA CEOs, but I have to, I have to be able to show them profiles of people who are exemplary of the, kind of. Skillset they&#8217;re looking for so that then we can anchor around the reality of real human beings, as opposed to, I mean, in, in.</p>



<p>Almost every search at one stage, we&#8217;ll all look at each other, whether it&#8217;s a CEO search or a COO search or a CPO search, and we&#8217;ll say, wow, I really wish I could get Tom plus, you know, Jen in one person and you can&#8217;t do that, but you can hire a CMO who spikes really high in these [00:19:00] areas. AZ and know that they&#8217;re a strong enough manager of people to hire to your point you&#8217;re head of PR and comms.</p>



<p>Right? So that that&#8217;s the, that it&#8217;s not so much that I have to the CEOs generally. Even if they&#8217;ve never hired a CMO before, once you start talking about the realities of how people come up, the ranks of marketing, you can show them what&#8217;s possible within one person and show them how that person can hire this person who sits on their team.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:19:34] Yeah. Well, it&#8217;s good to hear that. It&#8217;s good to hear that you&#8217;re not having to entirely reset someone&#8217;s expectations. How do you. So given the scorecard, given you&#8217;ve gotten past that stage in the process, how do you start building the top of your funnel?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:19:52] So typically once we know so from a, if you&#8217;re looking at a scorecard and the number one thing is [00:20:00] product driven, growth, product, marketing, messaging, positioning in that kind of environment, then you could say, okay, so you&#8217;re talking about companies like Twilio and at Lacien and Slack and new Relic and, you know, whatever.</p>



<p>So once you decide where the companies who are the companies that have been successful, doing the things you want to do. Right. And the great thing about marketing is there&#8217;s such a strong. Footprint out there that demonstrates their craft and where they&#8217;ve been successful. So then you can start to populate the top of your funnel with the people who lead the functions within those companies.</p>



<p>So, you know, in, in recorded future&#8217;s case, I mean, I won&#8217;t go through your competitors that we, that we targeted, but there were like, 10 to 12 [00:21:00] companies and really six or seven that Christopher really admired. And we brought the people running the functions to the table to talk to him. What&#8217;s the,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:21:14] is there, like, what&#8217;s the first thing you look at?</p>



<p>So you&#8217;re are you going to go to someone&#8217;s LinkedIn or where do you, what&#8217;s the first signal that gives you confidence? Cause I&#8217;m thinking about people, you know, right. You have a, you&#8217;ve talked to them and you know, they&#8217;re a fit, that&#8217;s the easy part. But what about that next level of talent? Who you don&#8217;t know?</p>



<p>What are the sorts of things that you look for that say, I should spend some time and getting to know this person,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:21:37] for sure. So I&#8217;ve probably done 120 CMOs searches. So there are, you know, if you take 120 and multiply it by 20 candidates for each project, there are hundreds of hundreds of CMOs that I would think of for any project, right.</p>



<p>There are lots and lots. Many of them will not be available because of timing. So I immediately have to go to. [00:22:00] That next line of folks at the same time. So, you know, these are the people we&#8217;re going to call immediately. These are the people that are in the queue, who are the VP of product marketing for, to the CMO at, you know, like Robert&nbsp; is the CMO at it.</p>



<p>Lacien his. Head of product marketing is the next person I&#8217;ll look at. Right? So I look at his head of product marketing and I see, so the first place I&#8217;ll look is I&#8217;ll look on, I&#8217;ll look at her LinkedIn profile and I&#8217;ll say, okay, she&#8217;s been at Lacey and for three years. And she was at Twilio before that.</p>



<p>And before that she was at Google, the very next thing I will do is look to see who I know well, who knows her. And I will quietly reach out, put on my list to reach out to those people. The next thing I&#8217;ll do, so I look at, I look at [00:23:00] who she is. I look at her on LinkedIn. I then go to the website of the company with whom she&#8217;s currently working in this case at Lacien.</p>



<p>And I&#8217;ll look at evidence. Of her digital footprint. So she&#8217;s running product marketing. I&#8217;ll look at the content they have online. I will look at her Twitter feed. I will look to see if she has any evidence of a blog. I will look at any con I&#8217;ll Google her name. I mean, it&#8217;s really basic stuff. You&#8217;d be surprised how many, how few people do it though.</p>



<p>And, and, you know, one of the things I&#8217;ll look for it. It might not be it will not be the only signal because there have been many times where I&#8217;ve looked at, you know, the. COO of Pluralsight, for example, Heather she just stepped down and actually a few months ago, but the former CMO Pluralsight, she has like 50,000 followers on Twitter.</p>



<p>Does that mean she&#8217;s a great CMO? No, but it means she&#8217;s pretty digitally native. Right? So, so look for those kinds of things. If that&#8217;s a requirement that&#8217;s [00:24:00] important. Once I&#8217;ve established who she is. She has a decent digital footprint. Then I would quietly reach out to a few people who would know her, who I know and trust and find out if they would call her for this kind of job.</p>



<p>So I&#8217;m not out or, and say, Hey, I&#8217;m talking to her. I will say, Hey, would you call her with this kind of job? And I&#8217;ll see the kind of feedback that I&#8217;ll get, but that&#8217;s essentially what I&#8217;ll do before I even reach out to her.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:24:30] You forgot to say podcast, by the way, you should also listen to someone&#8217;s podcast, you know?</p>



<p>No, no personal biases there, but&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:24:38] absolutely. And I, I missed the whole client base there too with Spotify, so yeah. Or broadcast as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:24:45] So then if that&#8217;s, what, what qualifies somebody, what are the things that immediately disqualify someone for you? I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s gotta be some interesting ones.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:24:55] I keep looking at the alligator on your pillow.</p>



<p>Well, it&#8217;s not an alligator on your pillow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[00:25:00] <strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:25:00] It&#8217;s that is a Aruba lizard&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:25:03] and a Roomba lizard.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:25:04] Yeah, it&#8217;s a lizard. My daughter likes to decorate the, my zoom meeting couch with stuff and for whatever reason it previously was Yoda, but now it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a lizard. So&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:25:16] that&#8217;s so awesome. Disqualifiers. There are a lot of things that are red flags LinkedIn profiles that have unprofessional photographs are a huge flag, particularly for someone who&#8217;s a marketer, they need to know how to market themselves. So if they have a an unprofessional of a photo, that&#8217;s not professional if they have a. Too many roles and too short of a time.</p>



<p>Yeah. I don&#8217;t really care what the story is. The optics are, are not something that I can bring to a client. So if you have five jobs in five years, that&#8217;s a real problem for someone like me, who is paid to bring on board, somebody who is going to be there long enough. To make an [00:26:00] impact and to live with it, that impact.</p>



<p>And so that&#8217;s a huge red disqualifier for me,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:26:05] less like those five jobs were spectacular companies that all exited, and it was just, you were the lucky or the Forrest Gump of tech Uranus in every amazing company. And you just got lucky. I&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:26:17] can&#8217;t imagine you&#8217;d have five and five years. But yeah, I mean, that, that is, that is if, if there is.</p>



<p>A trail there. If you were at, you know SendGrid that got bought by Twilio, that&#8217;s a great outcome. That&#8217;s a really good outcome. And so in that case, I am definitely going to be that&#8217;s. That goes from being a red flag to a big green flag, but you&#8217;ll often see on people&#8217;s LinkedIn profiles.</p>



<p>Acquired by, you know, or acquired by, and then you&#8217;ll dig in and find out that they weren&#8217;t there when the company was acquired. That&#8217;s another huge red disqualifier for me. If there are [00:27:00] discrepancies on your LinkedIn, if you put acquired by so-and-so on your LinkedIn and it&#8217;s after you left, and it&#8217;s not clear that it&#8217;s after you left, that&#8217;s a, that&#8217;s a challenge for, for us.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:27:15] Yeah, I think I have acquired by only because sometimes the lineage of the companies, like they just a company that was acquired by went away. And I want to try to create some sort of reference back to it used to be called this. Yeah. No, that makes sense. That makes&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:27:32] perfect sense. That makes perfect sense.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:27:34] I think it&#8217;s a really good point because a lot of, you know, a lot of CMOs unfortunately have short tenure. And if you choose wisely, if you choose poorly. So it&#8217;s so important to pick a company that you, you can be successful at, because you can sort of tell, even if it wasn&#8217;t your fault, it reflects poorly on you.</p>



<p>When you&#8217;re unable to choose the kind of job you can stay at for more than a year. I&#8217;m with you on that.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:27:57] Yeah. And I, I mean, I think everybody gets [00:28:00] a Mulligan, so it, you know, if you&#8217;ve been at one company for four years and then you go to another company for one and then, or the next company for seven.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not gonna, I will want to know what happened in that one, but I&#8217;m not going to disqualify you. It&#8217;s really multiple short stints. There&#8217;s almost never a good reason for multiple shorts. And so it&#8217;s better to not have that person on a. On a list when you don&#8217;t have to. So it&#8217;s a, and it&#8217;s a tough one.</p>



<p>It, it, it, it, again goes back to being very cautious. I mean, the F the, the venture firms and the private equity firms take bets across their portfolio, they&#8217;ll invest in, you know, 20, 30, a hundred companies. Your career choice is the only one you have for that period of time. And say, if we really, really protective.</p>



<p>About the company that you choose on the other hand, when [00:29:00] you, if you do make a mistake, it&#8217;s, don&#8217;t be one of the things I think is also disqualifier is real negativity around that mistake for it and be very transparent about it. Tell me or whoever&#8217;s interviewing why you took the job, what happened and why you left just don&#8217;t don&#8217;t try to cover it up.</p>



<p>Just talk about it and move on. Everybody. After they&#8217;ve had a career over a certain period of time has had some bumps and bruises.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:29:29] Yeah. Even at my level, I mean, I go, I do a lot of the same probing that you just talked about and when somebody throws their boss, their manager, their CEO under the bus, it just makes you think they&#8217;re going to do the same to me.</p>



<p>Regardless of what happens, you know, whenever the, you know, a year from now, this is not a good luck.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:29:49] Not no question. I agree. A hundred percent. Yep. I agree.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:29:53] So as a marketer, you know, I think about channels. What are you, what are your best channels? So as you&#8217;re building out all your, [00:30:00] all your stuff, what are the channels that work best for you?</p>



<p>And you&#8217;re doing your outreach.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:30:05] So LinkedIn looks, works really, really well for identification. Content works really well. Like we, like, I do like to. Get involved with organizations that produce content. So whether it&#8217;s, you know, him for her or the board list or black VC or others I like to be involved with organizations that, that outreach to their constituents with content.</p>



<p>So just web based content more thought leadership learning pieces, but LinkedIn is really, really powerful. I mean, it&#8217;s. It hasn&#8217;t diminished in the face of other channels it&#8217;s become, I think, more and more powerful. And then I think, you know, just making sure that. I know who the up and comers are, is really important to me.</p>



<p>One of the things that Heidrick that I learned was if you only focus on the people that are sitting in [00:31:00] the seats today. So the sitting CMOs, the sitting CEOs, and you are interested in growth companies that, that. Group of folks will pretty quickly become unrecoverable or irrelevant and irrelevant.</p>



<p>Not because they&#8217;re unsuccessful, but because they&#8217;re so successful, they will no longer want to be the CML of a $20 million company because they&#8217;ve had a $2 billion exit. Right. So. So I want to constantly, and I am constantly asking people like you, like who are the up and coming people I should know about.</p>



<p>So in every conversation I have, I just got off an interview before joining our podcast. I asked the person as we wrapped up, like, who else should I know about? Like, who. Who on your team was fantastic. Who are you most proud of hiring? What have they gone on to do? And so if I&#8217;m having, you know, five or six of those conversations a day, [00:32:00] you know, there&#8217;s probably five or 10 gems in each one of those days.</p>



<p>And so that&#8217;s just, you know, and then I add them to my. Mailing list. And I think you&#8217;ve seen these before. When I put somebody into a new seat, I send out an email about that and, you know, the folks can opt out, but they often opt in. And so it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s it&#8217;s broadly LinkedIn and other, you know, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and then it&#8217;s more targeted asking people like you, like who are your up and coming stars and trying to get in touch with those folks.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:32:33] Feel free to share that list with me too, for podcast guests, I would love to have, I would love to have access to that list, but yeah. Should I pitch you? So I think about a lot too, then the next generation of, if you&#8217;re a senior director of product marketing and you want to become a VP of marketing, you know, how does that actually happen?</p>



<p>Should people be pitching executive recruiters to get in front of you?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:32:56] Yeah. So this is the, one of the things that I think is widely [00:33:00] misunderstood about executive search is that we are, I mean, we should always be acting like talent agents. We should be constantly staying in touch with the folks that are out there.</p>



<p>Doing the work in the craft and who are up and coming rising stars. On the other hand, we only have so many projects we&#8217;ll work on a given time. And so yes, people should be getting in touch with my peers, with me, with others who are on the executive search side, but they shouldn&#8217;t expect. Immediate action.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s more about building a relationship. And we look at us, I mean, we started talking 10 years ago and it wasn&#8217;t until a year ago that I put you into the seat. Right. So it&#8217;s so the short answer is yes, but just be aware that it sometimes doesn&#8217;t glean results for a little bit of time, but it&#8217;s in both of our interests to build a [00:34:00] relationship.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:34:00] Because I think it&#8217;s so important because you are trusted. You&#8217;re a trusted advisor to the people at the private equity level, at the venture capital level, at the executive level to put people into these positions. And it doesn&#8217;t, there are cases certainly where people get promoted up and eventually land at the top.</p>



<p>But for most companies where, you know, the, the roles coming outside, you are, you&#8217;re building that list. You&#8217;re helping prioritize it. I just wonder if maybe it should be a bigger part of people who want to move up should be proactively trying to build relationships with people like you, that you see how many CMOs searches do you, do you do a year?</p>



<p>You think roughly?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:34:38] Probably 15.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:34:40] Right? So, and 15 of the graded, the great companies in tech are relying on you to build that list. I would. If I were in that market, I&#8217;d want to be on your radar.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:34:49] Yeah, no I haven&#8217;t. And that, and, and likewise, I think the other thing is that a lot of times people it&#8217;s a SIM it&#8217;s very similar on board searches.</p>



<p>For example, [00:35:00] people wait until they want a role to reach out to their network. You should be constantly building your network so that you have it and you can utilize it. When you need it, not that you&#8217;re building it when you need it. So, I mean, it&#8217;s just a really important thing. And, and, and I think the thing for, you know, for a lot of folks that they don&#8217;t understand is that it is incredibly helpful.</p>



<p>We deal in information. So you&#8217;re giving me something just by reaching out and telling me what you&#8217;re doing and what you&#8217;re interested in. Don&#8217;t think that I don&#8217;t get something from that. That&#8217;s what I get from that. And so then you can ask me what I can do for you. So it should be a reciprocal relationship.</p>



<p>So if you know, if I don&#8217;t have an immediate role as CMO, I&#8217;m happy to spend 15, 20, 30, an hour. And talk about what I would see as the gaps in your [00:36:00] background to getting to that CMOs spot. And what are you going to do for me? I&#8217;m going to find out before I get off the zoom or the phone conversation, I&#8217;m going to say, who else should I be talking about?</p>



<p>And who&#8217;s on your radar. That&#8217;s great. Who would you hire if you were looking for a head of product? Who would you, so I want information. It&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a two way street.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:36:18] Yeah. And it&#8217;s the only way you&#8217;re going to find, like you said, Everyone wants to hire the ex CMO of Slack because we all know Slack, but the ex CMO Slack, isn&#8217;t going to go work at your slow growth, $30 million.</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:36:35] Yeah. And nor should they, and actually, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s really interesting. I I&#8217;ve often been asked, you know, can you go get me this person? And they&#8217;ll ask me, you know, can you get me. Bill mcketis is the, XDMO get the bill and I&#8217;ll say, well, you, you know, as a, as a $20 million growth company, [00:37:00] don&#8217;t want him right now, you might want to talk to him.</p>



<p>Maybe he&#8217;s going to be an advisor. Maybe he&#8217;ll join your board. He joined the board of a couple of my clients. What you want is you want the people, you want the people that were on his team at that time and are now CMO somewhere else. That&#8217;s the person you want. Exactly. They, they have something to prove and they&#8217;re they&#8217;re stage appropriate.</p>



<p>So you want the person that wants the job and it is ready for the job and is raved before, but has seen the growth curve before. And so, yeah, it&#8217;s gotta, it&#8217;s gotta work for both&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:37:33] people. And the only way to, to get that is to do the hard work. Like it, it feels to me like you must be on your connect constantly on your phone, constantly building relationships and networking, and it&#8217;s gotta be.</p>



<p>Really hard to be honest. Right.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:37:50] It would be really hard if I was introverted. I get, I, like I said, I mean, it&#8217;s really, I love people&#8217;s stories and I love connecting the dots. And I also [00:38:00] love thinking about, you know, who in my client base could use his skillset and, you know, and I just, I really think it&#8217;s important to build.</p>



<p>Diversity of pipeline and relationships. And so, yeah, I mean, it is, it is, it is what I do.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:38:18] Got it. So let&#8217;s talk a little bit about diversity. So obviously almost every company, especially tech companies, and especially the higher up you go in an organization has a diversity problem, often a significant diversity problem.</p>



<p>And I think a lot of companies now understand that. That needs to get fixed and that the best way to do it is to solve it at the pipeline level to make sure that you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re purposeful about having a pipeline full of diverse candidates. What&#8217;s your role in that and helping address this? Significant challenge.</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:38:56] Yeah. So I think it [00:39:00] has, has to be intentional. It has to be incredibly intentional. I have definitely been involved with projects where toward the end of the project, somebody will say, you know, did we have enough diverse? Did we have enough diversity in the pipeline? And the good news is I build that in from the beginning.</p>



<p>So on our particular projects, yes, we have. But you have to approach these projects with a view of, you know, making sure that you have a diverse set of candidates you can&#8217;t have diverse is not one person. Like the definition of diverse is a group that has differentiation between it, right? So it&#8217;s a diverse group of people.</p>



<p>So first of all, what&#8217;s diverse from reported. Future might be different from what&#8217;s diverse for. I don&#8217;t know, WP engine. And so WP engine, for example, when I did projects for them, they have a woman CEO, they had a woman CFO, they had a woman COO who I put in her place. So when we went looking for a CTO, diversity [00:40:00] for them, didn&#8217;t look like diversity for most companies, right?</p>



<p>Like we diversity for them in a room of five C-level executives. Three of whom were women was male. Right. And, and so it was it age and gender diversity that didn&#8217;t look like another company&#8217;s diversity. So figure out what diversity means to your organization, and then make sure that you have those metrics set up to, to attract for that kind of diversity.</p>



<p>What it means is if you&#8217;re looking for a CEO, if you&#8217;re looking for a CMO. It means making sure that we are looking for that, we set the filters so that we can have diversity in a chief revenue officer search. For example, if you&#8217;re looking at SAS companies that have exited, so you want to CRO who&#8217;s gone through a liquidity event [00:41:00] in a B2B SAS company.</p>



<p>Less than 13% of those people are going to be female. So you can&#8217;t build a diverse pipeline with that criteria. Yeah. So, if you&#8217;re looking for a diverse pipeline, you have to make sure that your criteria will allow for that. So, you know, if you&#8217;re not, if you so includes COO&#8217;s in that case, includes CRS include VPs of sales include SVPs of sales and the CMOs search includes CMOs include direct reports to the CML and make sure that you are holding yourself accountable at every step of the way.</p>



<p>And I would say finally, the other thing is. If you are looking for one executive search to solve your diversity problem, you are looking at it entirely wrong. You&#8217;ve got to go bottoms up and tops down. You&#8217;ve got to make sure the top of your entry-level funnel is incredibly [00:42:00] diverse. You&#8217;ve got to make sure that within each organization, the succession plans that you&#8217;re building include diversity.</p>



<p>So if you&#8217;re a sitting CMO. And you happen to be you know, responsible for a team of 20, make sure 50% of them are diverse. Make sure you have diversity in your pipeline. Look at your own succession plan and look at it critically and say, do I have somebody to take over from me that is going to add diversity this organization?</p>



<p>And if you don&#8217;t go solve it,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:42:35] So we&#8217;re a few years into this journey where the realization has been obvious that we&#8217;re not doing good enough as an industry. Have you seen we, are we better? Have you seen positive signs that we&#8217;re getting better at addressing this problem?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:42:50] Yeah. I&#8217;ve seen really positive signs that we&#8217;re getting better at addressing this problem, but I, again, I don&#8217;t think that most companies, there are some companies who are doing a [00:43:00] tremendous job.</p>



<p>Yeah. But I don&#8217;t think most companies look at this with a long-term planning perspective and a long-term solution for the problem. And again, I think it really, you have to be incredibly deliberate about it and you have to use the data. You can&#8217;t figure out your problem. If you don&#8217;t look at the data. So look at your, look at all of your hiring funnels across your entire organization and, and hold yourself accountable.</p>



<p>So, yeah, I do think we&#8217;re doing better about it. But there&#8217;s so much room for improvement,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:43:34] which is a little ironic because as tech companies, we&#8217;re typically graded data. Like we are a, we are awesome at data, but I think it&#8217;s the data tells. A story. That&#8217;s difficult for people to accept, you know, in, in looking at diversity and it&#8217;s, so it&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s not it&#8217;s it&#8217;s, we, we all know why we have to look at data and we obsess about data, you know, at the exact team level.</p>



<p>But this is [00:44:00] a, this is a data set that just is not where it needs to be. But I agree&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:44:03] with you and we don&#8217;t, we don&#8217;t want to look at this data. And when we look at this data critically we&#8217;ll often, and I say, we but often what, what will come from it is. Oh, it&#8217;s it&#8217;s a supply problem. It is not a supply problem.</p>



<p>We have, there are plenty of talented women and people of color in every sector at every level, or are ready to be in those levels. So it&#8217;s not a supply problem. It is a unconscious bias. It&#8217;s a hiring process and it&#8217;s a lack of. Deliberation problem. And so we, we try and, you know, we also try to address it.</p>



<p>I think in certain functions, like let&#8217;s go hire a COO or let&#8217;s go hire a chief people officer and make that our diversity hire well, that&#8217;s great. Except it doesn&#8217;t, it puts a bandaid on the bigger problem, which is the company may have a [00:45:00] systemic issue within the organization when it comes to hiring and retaining talent.</p>



<p>So again, take a step back, look at the overall data, the same way you would marketing funnels, the same way you would sales funnels, the same way you would product usage metrics or churn data. Like most CEOs can tell you what their turn is immediately if they can&#8217;t they&#8217;re in trouble. So it&#8217;s it&#8217;s. Yeah. I, I think it&#8217;s not a problem.</p>



<p>That&#8217;ll get solved with one-offs and it&#8217;s got, you&#8217;ve got to use it, the data,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:45:28] I think it&#8217;s, I think to your point, it&#8217;s. Identifying it&#8217;s a problem. Identifying process changes that address the problem that are long-term. You&#8217;re not going to flip a switch overnight, but if you don&#8217;t get started now, this problem is not going to go away with a higher or two or three at the&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:45:46] no, and it, it, again, it really data will help us to take the emotion out of it and take the Erroneous conclusions out of it.</p>



<p>And we can then shine [00:46:00] a light on where the problems are. And instead of saying, you know, Hey, we&#8217;re not doing this right. It&#8217;s your fault. We can just say, okay, well, in this part of the organization, our engineering hires were incredibly diverse and we&#8217;ve done a good job retaining those people. That&#8217;s the other piece, but in the sales organization, not so much so let&#8217;s change it.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:46:19] Yeah. Well, Mercedes, thank you so much for both being on my podcast today. Maybe more importantly, getting me a job that I love and I get excited about every morning when I wake up. So thank you for both of those. I really enjoyed this conversation and keep in touch.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mercedes Chatfield-Taylor: </strong>[00:46:35] Yeah, it&#8217;s great to talk with you, Tom.</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:00:00] Hey Kyle. What&#8217;s up.</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:00:01] Hey, good to see you Tom. </p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:00:02] So you and I have known each other for a long time.</p>



<p>You&#8217;re one of the few people that has successfully bounced around between sales, marketing strategy, and now venture cap. How did that all happen?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:00:15] Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting. Yeah, loaded question. And I&#8217;m like just really entrepreneurial, you know, I think self as more of just a business person who happens to be good at the outside game stuff.</p>



<p>Right. Like, you know, I, I grew up in a family business actually majored in marketing at Bentley and wall fam, not too far from you and Winchester. Right. And you know, my first jobs were actually marketing, you know started out as a marketing associate doing a bunch of content writing. And then, you know, pretty quickly realized I could probably do some BDR work.</p>



<p>And then did your kind of classic, you know, sales ladder climbing from like BDR to junior aid, AAE to account director. And then I had an opportunity in my early career. I worked for an ed tech software company. I might have been when we first met, cause they had [00:01:00] a CMS for schools and you&#8217;re obviously you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re deep in the CMS game.</p>



<p>Right? When I was at Whipple Hill and I ended up running West coast sales and marketing for them where, you know, the marketing side of it was really more, it was out outbounding demand gen, and, you know, it was in positioning to the different types of prep schools that were on the West coast. And so, but when I got recruited back to New Hampshire we&#8217;ll get into that in detail.</p>



<p>I basically had learned in my first company that if sales and marketing aren&#8217;t in lockstep, which my. First company, they were not, it was like head of sales versus head of marketing. They were not friends and it was incredibly siloed and neither side was accountable for the other. I basically the job I knew I&#8217;d take as my first head of sales job, it had to be head of sales and marketing, and I was pretty firm on it.</p>



<p>And so I ended up becoming a VP of sales and marketing and then. When I was CRL, I still had marketing success, support BD Corp dev, which is all strategies. So it&#8217;s, it was kind of just natural take on more, take [00:02:00] on more. And really, it was just about owning the number and own the enterprise value creation.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s funny,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:02:05] there&#8217;s the CRO title became really popular, but I think very few CRS actually on marketing, like you own marketing, the team reported up to you. It&#8217;s sort of a vanity title. You&#8217;re going to call it a CRO and you give them marketing, if you&#8217;re going to do that, but it&#8217;s not how it works out.</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:02:21] Well, honestly, when I got it, I, it was probably, I think. I was VP of sales and marketing from like late 2008 to probably 2011 or 12. And then we created like a C-suite because it was basically two founders of dye and that&#8217;s the company help build a Dyn, the DNS domain name, system, company. And I, we basically created a C-suite and I became CRO.</p>



<p>And I actually, at the time, I always like CMO CRO, like chief growth officer, chief commercial officer, president. Like we were kind of like just kicking them all around. And then I was like, no, I need to say revenue because. I, I need, we need ultimate accountability to the top line of the company and do our growth.</p>



<p>And. I kind of like, felt like back then, [00:03:00] like in hindsight, I&#8217;m like I made it up. Like there weren&#8217;t a lot of CRS in 2011, 12, and you&#8217;re right. It like became this, like, I want a C suite title. I&#8217;m the head of sales. I&#8217;m reporting to the CEO, call me something that&#8217;s C-level officer. And then it became like, it&#8217;s really just the SVP of sales.</p>



<p>Right. And so, yeah, I think it&#8217;s interesting, you know, I&#8217;m buddies, I just did the Kyle Lacy podcast, you know, Kyle on revenue DIYers. And he was like, he&#8217;s making a big fight that like, why are marketing leaders, you know, taking over the, you know, sales teams? And I&#8217;m like, Hey, like, I don&#8217;t really like discriminate.</p>



<p>Like I&#8217;m a marketing major. My first jobs were in marketing. I went into sales only, honestly at the time, because I wanted to make more money and I was in-patient and then, you know, I ended up running both and I don&#8217;t, I think I&#8217;m kind of a brand guy and a sales guy and a BD guy. Like I don&#8217;t overly identify in the, in the straight lane of either function.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:03:53] The answer to Kyle&#8217;s question is. It&#8217;s a whole different game. When you own the number you&#8217;ve got to forecast the [00:04:00] number you got to deliver the number quarter after quarter, month after month and marketing, we kind of get there a little bit with leads, but you miss your lead target.</p>



<p>No one&#8217;s getting fired. You miss your, you miss your ARR target and you&#8217;re getting fired. I don&#8217;t think most marketers are ready for that. It&#8217;s a big step.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:04:16] I mean, carrying a court, I know you&#8217;ve got some se se bone in your body, right. And wounds from the early days. Yeah. But like carrying a quota, I mean, sales job is a horrible job.</p>



<p>Like it&#8217;s horrible. I mean, and I had a quota and I, I mean, for Don, I own that number though, top line, but like I co quota directly tied to you in the deals you win, that&#8217;s yours and yours only. It&#8217;s a really lonely existence. And I think what a lot of people forget is. No there&#8217;s base in variable comp you know, variables commission, and then there&#8217;s an OTE, which means on target earnings.</p>



<p>So like, if you&#8217;re a salesperson and you make a $60,000 base salary with an OTE of one 20, you have to go chase like [00:05:00] hunt for 60 grand. I mean, imagine you were an engineer or a marketer and someone told you half your pay was performance-based on like, Hardcore numbers and analytics like, like people that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s a tough existence, honestly, for people that live with that, I&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:05:15] there&#8217;s always the stories of that rep that made a million dollars.</p>



<p>Every company hopefully has that, that story and all the marketers hear that and say, you know, why, why wasn&#8217;t that? You know, I contributed that deal. They close, I sourced it. And my answer to that is always then go carry a bag. Like go do it. I encourage you. I encourage everybody to go through sales. It&#8217;s an awesome experience, but it&#8217;s a lonely experience too.</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:05:40] Yeah, it&#8217;s incredibly difficult. I sometimes still wake up in like deep sweats, you know, like thinking about like my quota as an individual seller from like 15 years ago. Right. Like, I mean, it, it really, and when I worked for Whipple Hill, the ed tech company, I actually moved to California and I was like remote and alone.</p>



<p>You&#8217;re trying to build out the region. And I [00:06:00] remember just. You know, not even knowing where to turn like marketing was more and, and like creative back then, you know, it wasn&#8217;t very like metrics driven and lead driven. That&#8217;s a newer thing in SAS. I think people forget that like the analytics and the metrics and the digital and the inbound is all really over the last decade, you know, it wasn&#8217;t really like that.</p>



<p>So sales people also had the light. Find their own dinner. And, you know, that was, that was really difficult back then. I mean, again, you can be an enterprise Oracle, which I got some experience that we&#8217;ll talk about later, very different game when you, when you can win a million dollar deals. But you know, most SAS services are not, you know, million dollar deals plus only to the enterprise market.</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s really a lot of deals, high velocity. And, you know, you have the bottoms up your way there, and you know, it in mythical 12 months, you know, calendars, right. Like I always used to get so annoyed this time of year you&#8217;re near the holidays and the end of the year is coming and I&#8217;m like, ah, but you know, if you really are good at sales, you game your [00:07:00] comp plan and you do make a lot of money.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re good at it, you can handle it.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:07:03] Let&#8217;s talk about New Hampshire. So one of the things that you and I always bonded over is our love, the great state. I was born in the six Oh three Concord high grad shout out Crimson tide. You went to school in Manchester somewhere.</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:07:14] I went to West. Yep.</p>



<p>Football player. I played football. I played football at Manchester West high school in Manchester, New Hampshire. And then also at Bentley and Walton.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:07:23] Nice. I was a, I played tennis. We were a state champions three or four years. I was there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what I&#8217;ve always sort of respected about you is your loyalty and commitment to New Hampshire. You built Dyn in New Hampshire, you built a really great, you know, a sort of a West coast presence at Dyn. Nick. I remember first coming to your office. I&#8217;m like, wow, this is&nbsp; awesome.&nbsp; Talk about like your low to New Hampshire and why you kept dying there.</p>



<p>And did you get pressure to move?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:07:48] Yeah, I mean, so it&#8217;s an interesting story. So I joined Dyn seven years in and two years after they had moved up to New Hampshire Dyn was actually found that it was stir Polytechnic Institute in Wester as a [00:08:00] kind of a college dorm room project. Basically the original company enabled companies to, or people to remote access back into their home networks.</p>



<p>You remember, of course,&nbsp; and so the, it actually hit the two of the co-founders were actually from Manchester and they didn&#8217;t know each other in high school either. They just, they just were like, Oh, you&#8217;re prevented aren&#8217;t permission. We should move to the mill yard, build, you know, the mill yards or like, you know, these huge skyscrapers on their sides.</p>



<p>Right. They&#8217;re massive. And it was incredibly cheap, you know, even our huge space. He went to his $5 and 50 cents per square foot per year. Again, I, there there&#8217;s much better now. I think we made the prices go up. But, you know, it was an amazing thing, but I grew up there. I mean, I had moved. Went to school in Waltham.</p>



<p>I had moved to California for a few years for my career. And, you know, I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d necessarily end up back. There are, I thought I ended up in Boston and the tech scene or what have you. But, you know, I was raised in a small family business and it was all about like, Community and give back and know your neighbor and, [00:09:00] you know, really the kind of like spirit of New Hampshire is very communal.</p>



<p>Like I, I text with the governor, I don&#8217;t say that to brag, but like, that&#8217;s just the state, right. It&#8217;s very accessible. It&#8217;s just very different. And so, you know, I think when I moved back here, the Dyn opportunity was interesting, but I also like. Didn&#8217;t know if it was going to work out. I didn&#8217;t understand the domain name system that, well, I didn&#8217;t know if there was an enterprise market for it.</p>



<p>You know, I was young. I was in my mid twenties. I didn&#8217;t know if I was even that good. You know, like, like maybe I&#8217;m like, you know, not as good as I think, like, let&#8217;s see how this plays out. So, you know, but I&#8217;ve always been just very committed. I have a very large family in the middle of five sons. So my parents, Don and Gail.</p>



<p>So I also think like when you&#8217;re the middle, you&#8217;re sort of like the glue child and I, I&#8217;ve kind of always treated. The companies, I run like families and try to like rising tides, lift all ships. And I think it&#8217;s just, it fits, it just fit with New Hampshire. It fit with dime the culture recreated. I mean, in a lot of the culture, our clients were the Twitters, the Netflixes, the Airbnbs, like [00:10:00] the Acquia is as you know, and, and there were cool brands that were also stealing cultural tenants from West coast companies and Silicon Valley.</p>



<p>And, and, but doing it, I think in a more pragmatic. No different way, because you know, we, we can we&#8217;re Yankees, that&#8217;s the way we think. So it&#8217;s still all mixed up in that, but like, it&#8217;s just like community impact. Like how do you drive up up a market and, you know, I think we&#8217;ve attached ourselves pretty nicely to the greater Boston tech scene.</p>



<p>And, but also with a little of our own&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:10:29] yeah. And Dyn was bootstrapped forever, but then you eventually fell victim to the venture world. Was there any pressure when you started taking money to, Hey, you can&#8217;t build a billion dollar business in Manchester, you guys crazy. Is there any pressure there to, to move&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:10:46] well meatless and there was pressure.</p>



<p>We didn&#8217;t raise money to where 30 million air. So not a dollar of outside funding. It was bootstrapped. And then, and then, you know, e-commerce sort of funded and, you know, One of the reasons we raised money was we, [00:11:00] we knew we needed the mature to sustain. Right. And we also one of our co-founders wanted to get a bunch of secretary off the table.</p>



<p>I mean, that&#8217;s the fact so we actually raised a $38 million series a and you know, somewhere North of 90% of that was secondary. So we put very little primary capital in the business. But even long before that we were getting like, Oh, you got a lot of questions. And a lot of eye rolls, even from the Boston scene, like, ah, you can&#8217;t possibly continue to scale it out talent.</p>



<p>And especially when you start to work with the internet elite, right. Those people at the internet elite. The high traffic, web properties, top hundred, top 500 Alexa rankings. And these companies are basically like, wait, you&#8217;re in New Hampshire. Where&#8217;s that? Can you point it out on the map? Is that, is that part, is that in New York?</p>



<p>And I remember I&#8217;ve got it that asked that a lot. It&#8217;s like the most ridiculous question. But you know, so yeah, the pressure was big. I think the. The board and the investors really embraced the culture, but they were really one to like push remote [00:12:00] offices and, you know, feel that, you know, get the field built.</p>



<p>I think by the time we were, I think it would have been different if we weren&#8217;t already 30 million and already whatever that was like 80 a hundred people. I don&#8217;t remember exactly, but we already were foundationally solid. By the time it happened, but yeah, I mean, I&#8217;ve got it. I mean, Famously. I remember Jason Calacanis, who was on our board for awhile, who everyone knows that kind of super angel investor.</p>



<p>I mean, he joined our board and he, he not only challenged with the company on that, he would challenge me personally, like on like what career success I could have, like how much enterprise value I can create for Dyn or other companies, or even for myself in personal wealth generation. You know, you&#8217;ll never get to these targets.</p>



<p>If you stay in New Hampshire. No, I can&#8217;t wait. I cannot wait to write him a letter when I hit the targets. He said, I couldn&#8217;t, you&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:12:48] gotta be pretty close to that.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want you to name and shame, but I bet there are VCs too. The big name West coast wouldn&#8217;t invest in New Hampshire company who looked back and probably do the math and say we would have done pretty well at, we put a [00:13:00] little bit into that.</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:13:01] I think, you know, Yes, that&#8217;s that&#8217;s spot on. But I also, you know, we did an internet protocol, you know, I don&#8217;t, and we monetize it better than anyone else in history, maybe with the exception of open DNS, you know, I think, I think it was also that mixed in and, and I, again, maybe I&#8217;ve matured, but you know, We were pretty young, you know, the five of us who really built Dyn that the original executive team, you know, no one had really done it before.</p>



<p>I mean, there was a lot of factors of why people maybe passed on us or missed us, or didn&#8217;t push hard enough on us. But you know, the exit ended up being a phenomenal exit. It was a ridiculous journey. We, you know, we created lots of jobs. There&#8217;s actually a alumni Dyn alumni group on Facebook. And everyone&#8217;s been posting like old photos from the years.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s just like, when you look at the culture, I think that was one of the challenges. I think I was just talking about this with somebody. Our culture was so good that like, when someone went to work at Dyn, they very rarely left. Right. And I actually think that [00:14:00] hindered the taquito system up in New Hampshire because people didn&#8217;t leave to go start because they loved it so much.</p>



<p>And, you know, near the end, it started to sort of suck as the VCs sauce on an IPO path or an exit path. And we raised more money from PE and we brought in a lot of higher gun executives to compliment us and the culture did change and became more like hardened and matured. And I don&#8217;t say that all. Good.</p>



<p>And you know, people started to leave, but I don&#8217;t think it created the same entrepreneurial culture. I wish it did that. Like, even like a HubSpot, I think has been able to spawn off a lot of good startups and now, you know, and that segues a lot to what I&#8217;m doing now, but I think we can change that over the coming years.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:14:39] I think the thing that you did that was really smart as you know, DNS, I was a DNS admin in college, so I was computer science major. I literally got paid like $4 an hour to go manually set up. You know, and I switched.com files across a bunch of Solaris boxes and next boxes, like I got DNS [00:15:00] and I remember explicitly your DNS is sexy campaign.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The thing that was a little bit unique for you for being a sales. Guy is you really focused on brand and not only do you focus on brand, but for the most boring internet infrastructure thing, there is the phone book for the internet. How do you make DNS?</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:15:20] Yeah. Well, the DNS sexy campaign, I think made Don and here, here&#8217;s why. People who knew DNS, who would be like, just like you would be like, wait, DNS is sexy. Like, Oh, you&#8217;re dying, you&#8217;re dying DNS. Like it is an icebreaker beyond icebreakers, every internet trade show. You know, we, we gave out over 20,000, t-shirts over the life of the company in that one campaign.</p>



<p>Right. I mean, it was insane. And then anyone who didn&#8217;t know what DNS was, would say what&#8217;s DNS. Like it was literally like an education. Opener for every single conversation across the entire landscape, whether it was a [00:16:00] employee you were trying to recruit or, you know, someone in the community, or was that a trade show with a customer or a partner, you know, you&#8217;d literally be able to open the door and have a conversation.</p>



<p>And I really think it like. Elevated the space in general, you know, the, the open DNS is the new stars that they&#8217;re assigns the optimized, you know, and this one exists today. A lot of Infoblox is like, when people start to say, Oh, like maybe this isn&#8217;t just the protocol. Maybe we can do some tricks with the protocol to make it a more valuable service delivery mechanism to do more things for security or performance or reliability or availability.</p>



<p>And it was just an absolute shot in the arm for the brand and also gave The company end to end a rallying cry. Don&#8217;t underestimate that. I mean, you&#8217;re in a security business, right? You have a lot of security depth in your company and data science and all that. If all of a sudden they don&#8217;t think of sales and marketing as this, like.</p>



<p>A femoral thing that lives over here that has no relation to them. And all of a sudden they can become [00:17:00] brand advocates and loyalists and evangelists and feel like you get them. That&#8217;s kinda what the campaign did like, but it was like, it was bearded engineers in Tivas in shorts in winter time, you know, rock and DNS is sexy shirts.</p>



<p>Like, like it was, it was amazing. And everybody, everybody loved it and everybody wanted a shirt. And so. It was, it was a big, big deal. The other, like, I don&#8217;t talk about this that much, but we actually launched DNS is sexy at the same exact time. A lot of the company&#8217;s story is built the same trajectory of Twitter.</p>



<p>Twitter was one of our first clients. They&#8217;re originally a $30 a year client. And by the time we sold, they&#8217;re paying over seven figures a year and I actually launched a tweet nerdy. Tweet to me, kept pain at the same at the same time. It&#8217;s dude, it&#8217;s a sexy at South by Southwest in Austin. And I thought, for sure, we actually printed like double or triple the tweet, nerdy to me, shirts thinking that, that, you know, the Dyn logo on the side or whatever.</p>



<p>[00:18:00] And I thought that thing was going to be the thing I was like, nothing&#8217;s going to take off. That&#8217;s going to be the thing, even I was wearing those shirts, not the VNS, the section shirts, and right away, we actually sent a bunch of those back to New Hampshire and all the DNS sexy shirts where like I was having to do like orders from Austin to get new ones.</p>



<p>So, you know, it&#8217;s just a funny, like little tangential thing that no one really knows, but it was like, I didn&#8217;t think it would be the campaign that would stand out.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:18:26] I think it&#8217;s probably two things. One you spot like the audience that owns DNS are. The sort of classic it TiVo wearing no one spoke to them.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s sorta like customer success in Gainsight. They validated a whole category of people who now felt they had somebody who got them. But I think the other part is, and this is the, this is the part about marketing that no one gets you can&#8217;t put in a marketing plan, give away 20,000. T-shirts like, what&#8217;s the value creation for doing that?</p>



<p>But we all know that a lot of it, Mongo DB did that and [00:19:00] InVision did that super successfully. And you did that super successfully. Don&#8217;t sleep on schwag as much as it sounds. You get people to do that. All of a sudden you will walk around South by Southwest and see Dyns schwag rolling around.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:19:15] I believe in schwag, I believe brand is culture.</p>



<p>I believe culture is brand. I believe your people and the people affiliated with your company are your best advocates. And they&#8217;re the ones that are going to take you to the promised land. And, and part of that affinity is schwag. I mean, I have a York athletics shoe company Cousy in my hand, you know, like I believe in that, I believe that&#8217;s how you drive relevancy.</p>



<p>You continue to stay in the hearts and minds. The other thing is. And the dime story, the people we were selling against were like, you don&#8217;t get fired for IBM people, right? Like, like, like when you look at like Infoblox or Neustar Verisight or&nbsp; at the time we were starting, who are the big juggernauts public companies who we competed against for DNS, the people selling [00:20:00] you, if you were assisted in, we&#8217;re rolling in.</p>



<p>10 deep in suits with briefcases, completely unrelatable to the system administrator, to the tech ops person and the SRE. And we walked in and, you know, we looked like that. We talked like them, we got them. We, we brought out and made friends with him and her and, and really got to know the people and. I think we&#8217;re very clear, like, Hey, you know, you can help us get to the next level.</p>



<p>You know, we are a launching pad for your career. You&#8217;re a launching pad for us. We can be sounding boards for each other. We really did consultative selling, but at small tickets, like it was, it was not like consultative selling at a hundred K or our deals. I mean, our company. Ended up having, like, I think our average ARR per customer at, at exit was $18,000, but it was pulled up dramatically.</p>



<p>We had one, $4 million deal. We had a handful, a million dollar deals. We had a couple dozen 500 K deals. And then most of it was 200 to [00:21:00] $500 a month deals at high velocity. And I just don&#8217;t think people like treat those customers. They become too. Self-serve too passive to sales assists. To to forgotten.</p>



<p>And we treated them all like, like gold. And the best story of that is actually I told the Twitter one a bit ago, but Oracle, guess what? Oracle paid us on their first contract per month.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:21:23] Thousand hours,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:21:24] 12, 600 bucks, 600 bucks a month. And it was for some like QA testing thing on their storage platform and like $600 a month when Oracle acquired us for a very good multiple on our enterprise revenue.</p>



<p>They were spending 900, like 80,000 ARR we land and expanded that account like six or seven times over the four or five years that we&#8217;re a customer because we realized like it&#8217;s worth going through procurement hell, it&#8217;s worth going through an enterprise sales process because we know our products act good and our customer successes that good and that we can get them to expand to [00:22:00] something better.</p>



<p>And, you know, and again, I just don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a lot of patients in the venture capital. Yeah, culture we have right now to like, to, to do that.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:22:10] It was more patients now and there was back then that looks good in a cohort analysis. That&#8217;s that&#8217;s what you, if you&#8217;d gone public, you would have shown that look 600 to a million is a pretty good, pretty good cohort.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s also why I sort of think that you, I remember hanging out with a bunch of South by Southwest, and again, why does a DNS company sponsor you through the best party at South? By Southwest? Every year I went there and I still remember. Actually, I don&#8217;t remember it that well, to be honest with you for a other reasons, but you&#8217;re like, dude, one of her I Werner Vogels from AWS is going to show up in my party and I&#8217;m like, no, he&#8217;s not.</p>



<p>And lo and behold at about 4:00 AM or 3:00 AM every year at your party, he rolls in like a superhero. Like that&#8217;s brand building, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:22:54] Gosh, like we were drinking lone stars and smoking Marlboro reds. Like I actually joke, I&#8217;ve never smoked [00:23:00] cigarettes in my life except with murder Vogels. It&#8217;s unbelievable.</p>



<p>I remember the first year he did our sales guy for the Amazon account Kyle Kermani again says to me Werner Vogels is here to see you. It&#8217;s like four in the morning for just shutting down. I&#8217;m like, nah, and as a gay seriously, he&#8217;s upstairs in the VIP. And so, you know, that&#8217;s the way it worked though.</p>



<p>W I think companies need to go with their customers are right. Yeah. Like it&#8217;s very easy to go to interrupt shows and, you know, cause that&#8217;s where every infrastructure company goes. It&#8217;s better to go to the, go to those companies or to the shows where like the executives are of the brands that you want to work with.</p>



<p>Right. And I think a lot of companies screw that up. They, they over pattern match to what you should do and don&#8217;t try to differentiate and what hasn&#8217;t been done before. And there were no other infrastructure companies that their shares. The other one that actually kind of was, was media temple. I remember media temple had a killer party every year.</p>



<p>It stubs the barbecue joint and you know, it [00:24:00] was unbelievable, but that was the only other company that was kind of like us. Who really embraced it and went for it. And they had, I played Cedar street courtyard, and the music we&#8217;d bring in there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:24:09] mean, unbelievable. Yeah. Tears tear tick. Well, I still listen to them from me, from them being at your your place.</p>



<p>Dave Kellogg, an old sort of old school SAS guys,&nbsp; if you&#8217;re a CMO, it can be good at two of these three things, product marketing. Brandon comms or demand gen. I&#8217;m a demand gen and product marketing guy brand is not my thing. And I remember at South by Southwest I&#8217;m like, Kyle man, can I give you some money to try to make us cool.</p>



<p>And and we did look cool. And music was a big part of your world, too. You guys used to bring bands in to Dyn. You&#8217;d bring big bands into, I had a great time at, at your the one we sponsored at South by Southwest.</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:24:48] Delta skirt. Yeah. I mean, that was a lot of the brand alignment with like dying, like that sort of independent spirit. We weren&#8217;t venture capital back we&#8217;re in New Hampshire and the lip for your guys&#8217; stay. Like [00:25:00] it was a lot of like indie bands that the Lumineers played there, you know, with the Lumineers and they played, they were like the.</p>



<p>Like there was seven bands and they played like fourth last, like they were not the Lumineers of today. Right. So like, it was, I was a lot of the correlation between like an independent brand and a startup, and then just like fighting for relevancy, fighting for air time, fighting for revenue, fighting for growth.</p>



<p>You&#8217;re fighting for survival. Right? Like that, that paradox in that correlation was like, Absolutely perfect. I mean, we even took a band called quiet life out of new London, Connecticut on tour with us through Europe, we took on day Amsterdam, Berlin. I remember like caring. Yeah. They&#8217;re like guitars and drum kits, like through the streets of London and Brighton, England, like, and it was just unbelievable.</p>



<p>And in this people, like, again, it&#8217;s like the DNS is sexy campaign. They literally like, Oh, I want to work with that company. I want to be a part of that community. I want to support startups. I want to support that [00:26:00] Dyn. I want to support bands. Like it was this weird connection. And again, we really embraced, we called the music meets tech series at our Dyn TVs, you know?</p>



<p>Yeah. You know, it just really, it really, really worked. And, you know, I still stay in touch with a lot of these bands. Like that&#8217;s the other crazy, like, like Dawes who headline? I think the self by party, they use fire the best one, you know, duh, he&#8217;s married to Mandy Moore Taylor Goldsmith. Now, like I was walking to back to like the Hampton Inn.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just like a crate actually in, in And the deer tick lead singer McCauley John McCauley is married to Vanessa Carlton, Gino. Remember these names from our high school you know, days, but, you know, so it&#8217;s, again, it&#8217;s just funny to see the rise and watch who makes it, who doesn&#8217;t, it, it parallels startups really closely.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:26:48] I, you know, I look back in and, you know, Aquia was a success story. I sort of feel like though the biggest stick I made was&nbsp; I under-invested, I wasn&#8217;t willing to make the kind of big bets that you made. And I think it hurt the company. [00:27:00] Potentially even a company could have been public if we had gone bigger there.</p>



<p>Cause I think you underestimate, it&#8217;s easy to look quarter to quarter to quarter and we hit our numbers, but to make the big brand bats is the thing that can actually take you to another step change level. And I never did that and I will never make that mistake.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:27:16] And I think, I think you were playing in a much larger market.</p>



<p>I think Dyn Dyn was outpacing the market and monetizing something that it was hadn&#8217;t been monetized before really. Right. So, so like for us, we had to like, Aggressively stand out. I got, again, it didn&#8217;t have its challenges. I mean, it was, it was actually very hard to fundraise for dying. It was actually very, very hard to climb up market for dying.</p>



<p>It was, it was really, really difficult to recruit, you know, when we started to need the talent that maybe it wasn&#8217;t in you know, kind of New Hampshire North of Boston ecosystem. Right. So it also had challenges to the brand part and the culture part. Like had to be a differentiator. We had to be an employer of choice or else it was, it was kind of like existential almost.</p>



<p>I do [00:28:00] credit Jeremy diamond CEO for like, just flipping me the keys too though in founder, because he was, he is an introvert and he is not a brand guy and he didn&#8217;t get it a lot. And a lot of times I&#8217;d be like, just trust me. And the only way, the only reason I actually think it worked and I got the, the, the rope I got.</p>



<p>Whereas, because I own revenue. If I didn&#8217;t own the sales number, I would never have gotten away with it.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:28:23] That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a CRO thing. Right? That&#8217;s exactly what I was just going to say. Cause that&#8217;s a big bet like you, and the only way you can do that to better hit your numbers. And that&#8217;s this sort of advantage of have at recorded future is, you know, we hit our demand gen numbers.</p>



<p>We have lots of rope to make brand, you know, quote unquote brand investments, which I&#8217;m doing at a much bigger rate now, but it&#8217;s only because you&#8217;re hitting the numbers and and you know,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:28:48] the numbers are here to a scale. Or the budgets are just big enough that you can do things with&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:28:55] they&#8217;re just big enough.</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:28:57] I&#8217;m giving a little pitch to get a little bit [00:29:00] more budget for my man, Tom,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:29:01] The other thing that you did really well, so brand was a big one. I think it all culminated.</p>



<p>I remember this vividly, you guys got hit by a huge DDoSs&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:29:09] attack.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:29:10] And of course you&#8217;re doing this, I think right around the time you&#8217;re getting acquired or right before. And I actually&nbsp; I see you on the today show.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Tell me about that? Cause you guys steered into it in a way I rarely see.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:29:22] So here here&#8217;s, here&#8217;s the deal and this is not an overly spoken about thing. The night. That was no, no, that was sorry. That was what was the date anyways? November 21st I believe, or a cover 21st and I wish I knew the exact date.</p>



<p>It was the day we set. No, it&#8217;s October 21st. The night before we closed the deal signed the definitive agreement with Oracle on November 21st on October 21st was the DDoSs. Okay. Or whatever, maybe I&#8217;m getting the dates wrong. I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m screwing it up. But whatever the date was, that&#8217;s the day we signed the LOI with Oracle [00:30:00] the night before we had actually signed it and had a board vote and Oracle had not counter signed it the next day.</p>



<p>So I wake up in the morning, I&#8217;m driving into work. I&#8217;m on the phone with my dad and I actually was just calling my dad to catch up and I keep getting missed calls from an international number. And so on the third one that let me call you back. And it&#8217;s Amazon AWS team in Dublin, Ireland, who was, who we worked with on, we ran AWS ECE, DNS naming.</p>



<p>So whenever you provision an instance, we were doing the naming and the global propagation. And so their monitoring systems were better than ours. Right. And they were literally like, Hey, there&#8217;s something up on the East coast you asked, blah, blah, blah. So I hustled into the office. I bee-lined to Adam Kauflin, who&#8217;s one of my co-founders of York IIE now, but at the time was our head of corporate comms at dime.</p>



<p>I said, this is the most important day of your career. And I said, we need to own this. So [00:31:00] proactively we need to be like way more transparent, way more open, way more aggressive, way more assertive. Because Oracle&#8217;s acquiring us, he had no idea. And he&#8217;s like, Oh, he&#8217;s my best friend from kindergarten. And my high school quarterback and Magister West, but had no idea because we were under lock and seal.</p>



<p>And, you know, I was afraid that, that, that anything can go wrong with the Oracle, you know, the mothership on the deal. Right. And so we just went on this. We, we, we did a quick session. We said, we&#8217;re going to be so responsive. We&#8217;re going to be so proactive. We did PR media like, like, like literally like, like, like media calls with like a hundred media people at once.</p>



<p>Like, you know, like, like press conferences. And you know, w when I looked around the room, to be honest, I was like last man standing at dying, like all the. Co-founders had left like early executives who would help build the company had left. And it was just very clear. I mean, also my role at the time [00:32:00] to strategy officer, but like, but like, it was very clear that I had to be the guy, you know, we have like an interim CEO, we were selling the company, you know?</p>



<p>So I had to be the guy and we just stepped it up. I mean, there was three letter agencies in our office all day long. Every Infrastructure company on the planet was calling us the collaborative because they were afraid of their own networks and systems. Obviously customers, obviously employees.</p>



<p>And in the back of my mind, I&#8217;m more insect that our deal with Oracle is going to implode. Oh my God. So we really crushed it. I mean, it was, it was like, you know, get on the today show you know in the USA today, wall street journal, New York times front. Paige, you know, quotes from me and articles with like Obama.</p>



<p>It was like, it was almost like high comedy know me. I&#8217;m sorry. I was like, geez. It&#8217;s like unbelievable. And I guess what ended up happening on the Oracle side, which they told me about later was they sat on it. They sat on the L the term sheet to execute it. Yeah, it must&#8217;ve been that October date then.</p>



<p>And basically they sat [00:33:00] on it and Safra, Catz said something along the lines of No. Well, at least now we know dad&#8217;s important and the world will know Oracle&#8217;s very serious about cloud and ink it and they suck it back. And honestly, the moment it came back, it was actually, we got attacked by three waves.</p>



<p>It was the ride bike net. So it was like a globally distributed, like it turned IOT thing, IOT devices into attack vectors on the scale of millions and basically We were the second wave when we got the counter signed agreement from Oracle of three waves that lasted the entire day. And it was just, it was just intense.</p>



<p>It was crazy. I thought it was some twisted, perverse, like due diligence by a workaholic or something&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:33:45] engineered the whole thing to see how your, how you&#8217;d hold up. Did you guys work with an agency at that time that this is classic crisis communications? One-on-one you guys do this yourselves? We did it&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:33:54] all of our, all ourselves.</p>



<p>We had no time to work with anybody. Like it was like, it was just [00:34:00] like, write me what I need to say. Like, no, at a, at a, at a, it was all ourselves at the time. You know, over the years we worked with different PR firms. We worked with launch squad. We work with, we worked with a K antler marketing agency.</p>



<p>We had different. Players in the mix. But that was honestly all us. I mean, there wasn&#8217;t enough time. Right. We had that. We had to react and respond pretty quickly. You know, we had to put together Root cause analysis RCAs. Like we had to just do a lot of like customer comms. And again, I think we were, I think, honestly, the thing that we did differently than we normally would have done culturally, we had done a lot of crisis comms planning was because we had our high SLA business tagline was uptime as the bottom line.</p>



<p>You know, it&#8217;s like, you kinda kind of are used to this. But I think the thing we did differently was actually the media blitz that, that was completely intentional to show Oracle the asset they were getting, because we sat on so much internet data and internet traffic view that, you know, it just was like record a future and your [00:35:00] security data, like, you know, it was very much for us like, Hey, we need to like, also use this as an opportunity to show them that like we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re serious and we&#8217;re legit.</p>



<p>And obviously it worked. I mean, when I got into Oracle. For three years, I was one of the top spokespeople for Oracle cloud. I was on stages speaking in front of 10,000 people. I was doing major customer calls with the biggest clients in the world. And I really turned more into like an evangelist BD strategy, Corp dev guide, Oracle product marketing guy at Oracle.</p>



<p>And, you know, I don&#8217;t know if it would have happened if we didn&#8217;t show them ourselves. In our full glory during the DDoSs. So weirdly maybe the best thing that ever happened to us was, you know, cause even now, like when I tell the Dyn story, even this morning, I was talking to former CSO or rapid seven and a few other places and he was like, Oh Dyn, man.</p>



<p>How has that DDoSs day? And it&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t know if everyone, like, outside of having to explain you remember dying DNS and your home router, like, like, like we&#8217;ve actually been able to like graduate from [00:36:00] the like early few years of the company because of that dude, us and the storyteller.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:36:05] Did you have to get certified at Oracle?</p>



<p>Cause you&#8217;re pretty, you&#8217;re pretty you know, you&#8217;re a great speaker, got a lot of energy, but you don&#8217;t really necessarily fit the ICP of an Oracle spokesperson.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:36:16] How did you&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:36:17] get&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:36:17] through that? Yeah, I mean, I did the, the, the media trainings of them internal media trainings or corporate comms. I developed an unbelievably, mutually respectful relation with Deborah Ellinger who&#8217;s, you know, she&#8217;s the bottom of every press release that Oracle puts out.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s been there, Mitch. Geez, maybe 20 years. She&#8217;s out in New York. She&#8217;s tremendous woman. We&#8217;re friends, you know, we&#8217;re Instagram pals. Right. But Deborah, you know, They very rarely would let me be alone. Anybody. There, there was always a PR counterpart in the mix. I would also, we earn a lot of respect with them or Adam who&#8217;s my co-founder in New York.</p>



<p>And my long-term friend, I mentioned a minute ago would proxy for PR a lot, which is really good. So I could be a little bit more me. [00:37:00] I also realized really early Oracle is in a existential transformation, as databases are moving to the cloud. And as they need to pivot to more of an infrastructure security business, And, and I was like a cruise missile for them to better relate to developers.</p>



<p>I mean, people forget that they own Java my sequel. Jeez, I mean, they&#8217;re doing tons and, and server lists and Coopernetties, and you know, it, there&#8217;s a huge developer investment in that place and who better to sort of help evangelize and make that. That don&#8217;t call it a pivot, but that evolution reinvention a bit than somebody who just built a startup in the, in that community.</p>



<p>So, you know, they gave me way more rope than you&#8217;d think. I mean, I remember once I did a seeking alpha, which is like financial inner interview and I was like, shocked. They let me but again, I think. W what&#8217;s your immediate dream? Like I can shoot from the hip a lot, but like, you know, I knew the lines.</p>



<p>Right. And I didn&#8217;t, I didn&#8217;t tell them, like I didn&#8217;t die. Right. I, I stayed reasonably distant from them to make sure, because I didn&#8217;t want to [00:38:00] sacrifice myself, my team, the company, the stock lots of different factors, you know, that wasn&#8217;t going to be on my hands.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:38:07] You get yelled at at all.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:38:09] Oh yeah, yeah.</p>



<p>Yeah. I get yelled at a lot because you know, I w I I&#8217;m. Pretty prolific on social media in like, you know, like. I think occasionally I would put stuff out there that wasn&#8217;t completely sanctioned. We got yelled at a lot because if you remember, we were in the internet intelligence technology, by the way, I wish I wish I wish that was living in your company now because I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re doing a lot with it anymore, but, you know, we would see things that would happen and the BGP or in the traces of the internet or carriers around the world.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s actually, when we got most in trouble, when we put something out that was maybe like, You&#8217;re talking about Comcast or talking about NTT. You&#8217;re talking about someone who is probably a customer of Oracle, basically everybody, whether they like it or not, as a customer somehow [00:39:00] are connected by one degree of separation as a customer of Oracle.</p>



<p>And so those are the only times we really heard it. So what I would hate actually is the way they would deliver me a feedback after like Like a panel at a conference or a speaking gig at a conference or at an analyst summit. That was actually the most annoying because they&#8217;d be like, Hey, you should really not like, say that next time you, you, you know, no one, no, one&#8217;s, you know, I remember once they were like, no, one&#8217;s allowed to talk about Larry that way.</p>



<p>And I was like, what do you mean? I said, I said, good things about where, like, you&#8217;re not allowed to talk about he&#8217;s off limits. I get it. Okay. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:39:37] I used to live in Redwood shores. So I live near Oracle and I would see Larry has this famous garage with all this super high end sports cars. And if you if you hung around, you&#8217;d see him in a new one.</p>



<p>Every so often look, I&#8217;m a big Larry Alison guy because he went to university, Illinois, my Alma mater, so, and Oracle great thing about it was when I lived there. They had a [00:40:00] subsidized cafeteria that for employees and you can get incredible sushi for dirt cheap. So Oracle&#8217;s always in my heart&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:40:08] for that.</p>



<p>A lot of my time. I mean, I spent a lot of time at Redwood shores building 500. But I also spend a ton of time in Seattle because a lot of the cloud infrastructure group that was like 10,000 people that I ran strategy for. Was in, was in Seattle. They&#8217;re all former Azure and AWS people. And that&#8217;s the cloud infrastructure cloud platform, capital of the world.</p>



<p>So you know, it was, it was a lot of trips there, which I actually, I prefer.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:40:37] Yeah. And think about that New Hampshire kid, Whipple Hill, tiny little company starts dying, ends up at Oracle of all places. That is a pretty fucked up story.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:40:50] It is. And, you know, I reported for awhile, right? When we got acquired, I reported to Thomas Currian.</p>



<p>Thomas is now the CEO of Google cloud. And then are a part of the Don [00:41:00] Johnson who, who both of them reported to Larry gone still there and Don runs Oracle clot. And so, you know, it was a fascinating, it wasn&#8217;t just that we were there in a workable it&#8217;s that we were like, I&#8217;ve been to Sanford&#8217;s house.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been to Larry&#8217;s house in San Francisco. Like, you know, it was the weirdest, most surreal. Experience, because again, I didn&#8217;t identify as a senior executive that Oracle at all. Right. And it was almost like I moved to San Diego for awhile, my early career for Whipple Hill. And I always felt like I was on vacation.</p>



<p>Right. I I&#8217;m a tourist here. This is not my home. Like, I don&#8217;t like, it&#8217;s great. It was awesome. Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I, I had the best experience of my wife, Katie there, but that&#8217;s kind of how Oracle felt. It was like. I have a lot of like out of body experiences where I&#8217;d be like, be like, like what, where am I?</p>



<p>Like, I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m on stages here. Like I keynoted the backup you security conference, you know, like, like, like literally in Vegas, like keynote at the conference, like with, with Krebs, Krebs [00:42:00] was like the year before. And I was thinking that you&#8217;re after, you know, so, so it was this really interesting thing.</p>



<p>I wouldn&#8217;t change it for the world. I mean The experience I gained, I never got like a hardcore MBA. I never worked in a big company before to see how it all works. I never worked in like traditional enterprise and top down selling and CIO selling. So there&#8217;s just a huge organization with different bureaucracy politics to navigate.</p>



<p>I learned an absolute law and I, and I think it, it, it. Really helped me sort of evolve and be more than just a startup guy or more than a sales guy or more than a marketer and then more of a general business person. And you&#8217;re going to remember that was the first time inside. I ran a $150 million dime P and L and then I was head up strategy for a multi-billion dollar cloud division, like I said, kind of dual role.</p>



<p>That was the first time I ever ran Dyn as at the tippity top as the, like the guy accountable to the P and L. So, you know, I mean, it was always at the top CRO charter revenue or chief strategy [00:43:00] officer in charge of strategy, but I wasn&#8217;t like the, the, the be all end all and having to report to Thomas and Safra and Larry, how we&#8217;re doing.</p>



<p>And Mark heard at the time, rest in peace, but like, you know, it was a different game and it was a great experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:43:13] It tied it all back to brand. The other thing I admired about what you did is. And you held onto this for a long time. Oracle Dyn. I remember driving by the building and&nbsp; it was important to keep the Dyn brand.</p>



<p>And I&#8217;m sure that was not an easy conversation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:43:27] No. And even when we got, even when they were fed up with it and they wouldn&#8217;t do it anymore, I got into replace the Dyn side on the big, the big building with an Oracle sign. By the way, they actually moved the office to Nashua. They moved the employees that Ashleigh, because it wasn&#8217;t a Oracle owned, died in own the building, just the tight end, massive, massive mill building.</p>



<p>And the Oracle sign&#8217;s still there. And, you know, the thing was like pretty petty. I don&#8217;t even know how they&#8217;re going to get it down, like, but the thing is still there. So we have like an over under of like how many years now is Oracle [00:44:00] going to be in Manchester, in the old Dyn space with a huge sign, lighten up familiar.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re actually, if you head up today, don&#8217;t go 93, go to 93 and you&#8217;ll get a great glimpse of it. It&#8217;s probably still lit up.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:44:11] I will do that for you. All right. And last thing, this has been fantastic. So you, you went back to your true calling, your your you&#8217;ve always been a startup guy. You know, I remember you pitching me angel investments for the past eight years, and now you started your own, your own firm.</p>



<p>So how did that happen and what problem were you trying to solve?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:44:36] Yeah, so here&#8217;s what was happening to me for the last couple of years of dying. And then certainly after the exit and then inside Oracle, you get asked all the time as an entrepreneur. What are you going to do next? And, you know, I was getting asked a lot.</p>



<p>Are you going to go be a VC and join a firm? A lot of people, you know, that I respect have gone and done that become a managing partner you know, a battery as a coy Andris and a [00:45:00] general catalyst to a tier one venture firm. Or are you going to go be an entrepreneur? You&#8217;re going to join a startup, or you&#8217;re going to, you got to start one yourself.</p>



<p>And it was like incredibly binary. Right? I was like, this is like so annoying. Like I love doing both. Imagine, imagine there was a, a business, a company. A scalable enterprise that enabled bolt. And you know, when I, when I surveyed the landscape, I looked at like investment banks. I looked at analysts firms.</p>



<p>I looked at management, consultancies, PR, and marcomm shops. I, I looked at SAS businesses. I looked at BCC funds and I was like, man, they&#8217;re all like, like one of thousands, like there, there, there there&#8217;s the top ones. And then there&#8217;s like a ton of others. And I feel like if I just pick one, I&#8217;m going to be like an aunt for a while and I&#8217;ll get lost in a sea of noise.</p>



<p>And so at York it is, we call it a vertically integrated investment firm powered by market data and analytics focused on growth, go to market strategy. And how we provide to the market is we&#8217;re building a marketing competitive intelligence platform called fuel. Think of it like operator [00:46:00] version of Crunchbase or PitchBook or Traxon or Owler.</p>



<p>But for operators is a lot of operational workflows. We call smart notebooks on top of the private company, private market database. And then we launched managed services, advisory services on top for market product strategy, business growth strategy, and marcomm services. So PRA AR content social, and we we&#8217;ve tailor made them and modularized them for startups.</p>



<p>And then in the cream of the crop, B2B SAS businesses, early stage, where we can lean in and be an operational extension of those teams, we will invest half a million to a million dollars out of our. We don&#8217;t have a fund. We call it a syndicate model that you&#8217;re eventually going to be a member of. That&#8217;s basically, you know, it&#8217;s high net worth individuals, family offices.</p>



<p>They give us an annual commit, a five-year pledge, and they&#8217;re part of an evergreen syndicate. We&#8217;re not a fund. So we don&#8217;t charge management fees or pass through fees to you. We only make money like a commission, like a sales guy at carried interest on the gains on a deal by deal basis. [00:47:00] And so we, we launched this thing in September of 2019.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve done 18 investments. We&#8217;ve deployed about $8 million into those startups. They&#8217;re all B2B SAS up and down the stack, obviously have an affinity for cybersecurity, for infrastructure, for cloud platforms, for dev ops, for dev tools. But we&#8217;ll do, we&#8217;ll go all the way up to horizontal and vertical SAS solutions and tech laggard industries are where we think those right players, right.</p>



<p>For disruption. And, and we&#8217;re having a great time. We&#8217;ve got, you know, about 30 outside consulting and advisory customers. Our a R a R R is growing. So like, we&#8217;re not like retired operators, like we&#8217;re building a company, supporting other companies. And I really think we&#8217;re going after like McKinsey Bain, BCG meets Gartner Forrester.</p>



<p>Yeah, IVC meets Mark on PR shops speeds. Boutique investment banks meets seed funds meets marketing, competitive intelligence platforms like, like all-in-one in a vertically integrated way. [00:48:00] And. COVID weirdly has like integrated us way faster, you know, like the beginnings of York, you were like an investments business, a consulting advisory business, and a product roadmap, right?</p>



<p>Like who knows like a, like a studio it&#8217;s completely become the vision. I just said where we have the platform, we build services over the platform. We use the platform to do discovery, diligence, market tracking, company tracking, reporting and we&#8217;re eating our own dog food. And we plan on launching that SAS.</p>



<p>Business and platform in the first half of next year. So it&#8217;s really cool. It&#8217;s really fun. I, you know, I&#8217;m not raising venture for any foreseeable future for the core operating company where the IP and the technology and the customers live, but we are working with high net worth individuals and family offices who invest with us into the startup portfolio that is growing and emerging.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:48:51] Nice. All right. So last thing, this is going to go live on Monday four days before Christmas, is that true? Four days. Can we still [00:49:00] order shoes from York athletics and get them on time for Christmas, or we&#8217;ve passed the window.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Kyle York: </strong>[00:49:04] It&#8217;s going to be really, really tight, but if you put in the notes, when you order, you need it, they will hustle hustle, and there are options to accelerate shipping, but you should definitely get some New York athletics.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s my third generation family business startup. Great gym shoes. I know you&#8217;re a supporter and aware. I really appreciate it. Thanks for the shout out.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:49:24] Cal made great catching up with you. Congrats on all your success.</p>

Lynne and I talk about moving from Marketo to the <a href="https://www.acquia.com/products/marketing-cloud/campaign-studio">Acquia Campaign Studio</a> and the importance of “drinking your own champagne”. We also talk about how to execute a large website redesign project and why Lynne fought to rebrand the traditional sales kickoff as a “sales + marketing kickoff.</p>

<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:00:00] hey Lynne, how are you?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:00:01] Hey, Tom. I&#8217;m great. Thank you. How are you?</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:00:04] I&#8217;m great. It&#8217;s good to talk to you. It&#8217;s been a about nine months or so, is that right?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:00:10] Yep. I think so. Right. Time flies,.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:00:13] talk a little bit about yourself and your role.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:00:15] Sure. I&#8217;m the CMO at Acquia. So I have responsibility for all of the global marketing functions at Acquia. ,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:00:22] this is&nbsp; your second time in Acquia. You and I have both been back in Acquia two times. We&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:00:28] are, we are both boomerang. Hers. Yeah. Yeah. So I, I&#8217;ve been here now for about a little over three years, and then I was CMO back towards closer towards the beginning of Acquia, for a few years and left in between to go run a nonprofit, raise my kiddos and, do a little consulting work.</p>



<p>So, and then, I was happy to be back, as I say, fell back in love again and came back in.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:00:53] Yeah, it was interesting for me to, to be there in the middle part. So you were there in the early part. I was there in the middle part and for me to come back and [00:01:00] see how you adapted the marketing team is, is a former CMO.</p>



<p>And now his current CMO, I&#8217;m like, Oh, so that&#8217;s how you&#8217;re supposed to build marketing teams at big companies. It was really interesting to see how that team exactly evolved and. it was fun to be able to go back.</p>



<p>And even if it was a pretty short time, the second time for me to see all the things he did, and it was a really impressive for me to say,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:01:23] well, I really enjoyed working with you. So we&#8217;re still missing you at Acquia.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:01:26] The big challenge for me is at Acquia.</p>



<p>&nbsp;I was a subject matter expert and you would put me on stage a lot and I would appreciate that. It&#8217;s hard here because I am the furthest thing from a subject matter expert in cybersecurity. I know enough to get through an elevator pitch,&nbsp; it&#8217;s one of the hard adjustments for me is I don&#8217;t get to do that anymore.</p>



<p>And I miss it.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:01:44] I bet. I bet.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:01:45] so thanks for joining me this podcast.&nbsp; It&#8217;s like a forcing function for me to talk to people smarter than me that I can learn from. And there&#8217;s three things I pulled out that I want to learn from you. And these are all three things.</p>



<p>That I&#8217;m currently facing at recorded future. So I&#8217;m hoping that we [00:02:00] can go into those three things and they are switching marketing automation platforms. So you just, I think, finished up a big migration away from Marketo. So I&#8217;m going to talk to you all about that. A couple of years ago, you did a huge website redesign and I&#8217;m about to do the same.</p>



<p>So I&#8217;d love to get your experience in that. And then lastly, I love one of the things I noticed you did at Acquia was. Change the sales kickoff to be a sales and marketing kickoff. And I thought that was brilliant. And it&#8217;s it. Wasn&#8217;t just a name only like you actually made marketing a first-class citizen at the event.</p>



<p>So I want to ask you about that a little bit, because it&#8217;s something that we wanted to hear at quarter feature too. Sound good? Okay.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:02:37] I&#8217;m ready. I&#8217;m going&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:02:38] to keep you busy so you better be ready.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:02:40] All right. Fire away,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:02:42] so let&#8217;s start with, with marketing automation ? So for a long time, Acquia was a big Marketo shop.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m a HubSpot user here, and I feel like, with a marketer or a HubSpot, you pick it for the right reasons, you scale with it, but then you get to a part, a point where things start to break. [00:03:00] And we&#8217;re definitely at that point now with HubSpot, where is a much bigger company than we were when we picked it, things are just really starting to break.</p>



<p>So, but switching marketing automation is one of the hardest things to do in business.&nbsp; it&#8217;s such an operational part of the day-to-day workflow of a marketer. as you made to that journey yourself to switch from Marketo to your own campaign studio, how did all that work?</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:03:23] So it was a big project, for sure. You know, first of all, I, I approached it as we, we really wanted to do it for a couple of reasons. One of which is. I always want to drink our own champagne, as I say. So, you know, Monica, which is now called campaign studio is, was one of our products. We had an acquired product and we want, I wanted to be able to use the product ourselves one so that we can provide product feedback to the product team.</p>



<p>as well as obviously I want to be able to have our own product shine and to be able to use it as a marketer and also would give me confidence in terms of talking to other marketers about using a product. So, I figured we probably had Marketo for [00:04:00] maybe seven years. I don&#8217;t know. Did you install it with you?</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:04:03] Yeah, yeah. Yeah. We just purchased it like two weeks before I started.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:04:08] Yeah. So probably maybe seven years or so. Yeah, is what I&#8217;m guessing. So, you know, we had it for a very long time and then not. And obviously, you know, we have had a team of people that work on it. I&#8217;d have to hire Marketo specialists that knew a lot about Marketo to even use the product.</p>



<p>And it was becoming a pretty large team of people, just to be able to support the product and then having just the overhead costs of that. So not only the cost of the people, but. You know, the cost of just the, the whole using Marketo itself, where they, whereas, you know, if you&#8217;re at a million records or larger, you know, you, it&#8217;s very, very costly.</p>



<p>And so I was really looking to reduce my costs, not have to have such expertise within the staff and to be able to have the team use an easier product for what we wanted to accomplish. Particularly when it came to things like, you know, cross channel. So, so it was many months in the [00:05:00] making, but it&#8217;s because I wanted to make sure that we did it the right way that we transitioned everything over.</p>



<p>and it&#8217;s done today. I&#8217;m completely off of Marketo and I&#8217;m really glad that we made the switch.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:05:10] Yeah. Congratulations. What was the, what was the hardest part about that journey?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:05:17] I think the hardest part was just identifying what we did have in Marketo. I mean, we had like give you an example, like we had, even like we were using Marketa to do forms for the site.</p>



<p>We had like 500 forms. So even just tracking them down to try to figure out what we had. That was that wasn&#8217;t like one of the biggest things that we had to go through is we weren&#8217;t even sure what was in there. You know, like we&#8217;re kind of weeding through seven years of trying to, you know, get to the bottom.</p>



<p>So, I think that was probably one of the hardest parts was just, you know, doing the inventory to know exactly what we had and what we were transferring over. But, you know, campaign studio is pretty agile. So I went from 500 forms to 20. Wow. Yeah. So, so much easier for us. And then just using the product [00:06:00] itself is easier.</p>



<p>So I can have the campaign management folks do those in marketing operations. Do my campaigns much faster, quicker, easier than what we ever had&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:06:08] before. And you said something about channels. Are you doing more channels with campaign city or now, too? Yeah,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:06:14] exactly. So not, it&#8217;s not just email. Right. We just did email through my kiddo, but now we&#8217;re doing, you know, social texting.</p>



<p>Yep. You know how other channels? Yeah. Cool.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:06:25] I get a call from a Marketo rep right around renewal time, or they know exactly when our renewal is and right around renewal time. I get that call. Hey, are you ready to move? And maybe after this conversation, I&#8217;ll get a call from some Acquia BDRs.</p>



<p>my renewal&#8217;s up I&#8217;m in three weeks. So they have a very short window. But for people like me, it seems daunting to move off for all the reasons you talked about. We have processes, we have hundreds of forms. We have hundreds of automations, but I think you&#8217;re saying there is a light at the end of the tunnel.</p>



<p>If you put the effort into getting there. So would you [00:07:00] encourage other people to not be afraid of, of looking at moving if they&#8217;re not happy with what they have?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:07:05] Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I don&#8217;t think anyone wants to go into a, like a rip and replace situation. Right. Because it&#8217;s daunting and it&#8217;s difficult and it&#8217;s a little bit challenging, but for me, in terms of doing it.</p>



<p>it was definitely worthwhile. I&#8217;m glad that we did it and glad we took the time upfront to go through it all. And, it definitely was worthwhile. So yes, I would, I would certainly encourage people to take a look at it. and to, you know, don&#8217;t be afraid to embark on it because it is well worth it.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:07:30] Yeah. Excellent. So the second thing is. You did a big website redesign. That was one of the things that, you know, that I, I was very clear as I was following your journey and Acquia journey. And it wasn&#8217;t like a little project. I think it was a massive, like start from scratch project, you know, driven in part by your, your need for a more modern visual brand driven by, I think the migration to Drupal eight, you know, I&#8217;m in the same boat now, you know, we have a, a [00:08:00] WordPress site.</p>



<p>when I joined here, the first question everyone asks is, are we going to move our site to Drupal? And, we have some people on the team that are staunch WordPress advocates, and we&#8217;re not going to move to a, to Jupa right now, but. we do have a big website redesign project in mind, and it&#8217;s scary as heck, to be honest with you, it&#8217;ll be one of the biggest things we&#8217;ve ever done at recorded.</p>



<p>Future it be the biggest single investment we&#8217;ve probably ever made at recorded future. So I want to ask you a little bit about that. so even though I know it&#8217;s your business. I think it was a big project for you, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:08:32] It was a huge project for us because when we embarked on the new site, we did, we also did a rebranding.</p>



<p>So it was one of the reasons why we did it actually, just because we needed to refresh our brand. and it was certainly time for us to do that. Literally we had a six-year-old site and it was time for us to rebrand and do the site all at the same time. So it was a big project.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:08:52] And that six year old site was not much different than the ten-year-old site.</p>



<p>We just put a little fresh coat of paint on it. You, you did [00:09:00] a whole, you tore the house down and built it up from, from scratch, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:09:02] We did. We didn&#8217;t. Exactly.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:09:04] Yup. And so we did, we did that the actual brand redesign three months ago. So we did it a little bit, the other way around. we did a whole brand refresh project and the last channel&nbsp; it&#8217;s going to go live on is going to be the website.</p>



<p>So in some ways we have parts of that solve. But I&#8217;m scared, where to start, we&#8217;re going to work with an agency that&#8217;s actually a pretty strong Acquia partner, but my questions are like project management. how long did this project take end to end?</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:09:33] I&#8217;d say probably start to finish. I can remember kind of seeking the funding and the like it&#8217;s fun kind of day one. And then I&#8217;d say probably I&#8217;d say like seven months altogether.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:09:44] how hard was it to get funding? I haven&#8217;t brought my final request to my boss yet. how hard was it?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:09:52] it it&#8217;s always a process, right?</p>



<p>And so you need to work with kind of your internal stakeholders, but I worked on the exec team, a [00:10:00] couple of goal rounds, I&#8217;d say. So it took a couple of presentations in order to, you know, to do convincing when, what finally got the entire exec team to, The two to agree on it and to have us move forward on it was when our CFO, agreed.</p>



<p>And when he, that day in the meeting, when he turned and he said, I think this will be a good investment. I said, slips up that piece of paper right across the table sign right here.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:10:20] Right here.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:10:21] Yeah. Well,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:10:23] no agrees on it. Yeah. There you go.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:10:25] Well, because I think we were able to show, you know, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a lot of good return on investment.</p>



<p>You can get, especially right now, right. With everything being such a hundred percent digital, it&#8217;s like. In some ways, like it&#8217;s every everyone&#8217;s content bingeing, everyone&#8217;s going to sites, everyone&#8217;s spending so much time that it&#8217;s, you know, you need to make sure that your site is, you know, not just reflecting your brand.</p>



<p>Right. But it, but that it&#8217;s, you know, is it providing value? Is it, is the right messaging? Is it the right level of content? Because everyone&#8217;s doing content researching themselves, right? Yeah.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:10:57] It&#8217;s interesting too. We spend all this money on. [00:11:00] Brand awareness. We spent all this money on demand, gen everything converts to the website, but like you said, it&#8217;s these awful landing pages that are five years old.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s this awful website that&#8217;s slow and hard to navigate with content that&#8217;s dated. It&#8217;s so it&#8217;s funny it&#8217;s but it&#8217;s so much easier to justify spending money in other places, but then it comes to the website and you&#8217;re like, well, no, that, that large multi six figure check, we&#8217;re going to re how are you going to justify that?</p>



<p>Well, everything else is going to work better because we have this amazing website. and you guys work with an agency to like a pretty big, pretty big digital agency.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:11:36] We did. We&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:11:37] did that. How did you select that agency? How, how complex of a process was that?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:11:43] well, it was a typical RFP process.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:11:45] So we,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:11:46] you know, we picked a couple of we, I think maybe we picked four, to bid out to, and then we worked with them through the process. We picked someone that could help us not only on site design, but also on, branding. And so we picked an organization that could help us, you know, really help us [00:12:00] with whole exercise.</p>



<p>We had to go through for rebranding as well as kind of the design of the site. And then we actually did the development work ourselves because I wanted my team to be able to do the, you know, we didn&#8217;t need help on development for it. Cause that&#8217;s what we do.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:12:12] Right.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:12:13] so we did, they did that branding and helped us with branding and design.</p>



<p>Then we did the implementation and then, you know, we&#8217;re still updating, right? So that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s over fed over two years now. We&#8217;re in the process right now of a little site. it&#8217;s not, not as major effort as what we did before, but we&#8217;re migrating over to Drupal nine. we&#8217;re taking advantage of that, of migration and now looking at a different user interface for the site.</p>



<p>So again, we&#8217;re polishing it up because. You know, the thing about your site, right? Is when do you, when do you ever done? Never because it&#8217;s always, it&#8217;s always ongoing, but we&#8217;re using the same branding. We&#8217;re sticking with the same messaging that&#8217;s been working for us for the past year and a half or so.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:12:49] I think it&#8217;s been consistent, you&#8217;ve resisted the urge to make any sort of big changes, I think, which is great. How, which content came over from, [00:13:00] from the new site. So one of the challenges we have is, we have. 10 years of content and more than two thirds of it is completely out of date and needs to be refreshed.</p>



<p>Did you just start from scratch, migrate over, how much content came over from the old site to the new site?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:13:16] I don&#8217;t know exactly how much, but I, we did do the first thing that we did was a content audit. So that&#8217;s definitely the first piece of work that we did was to figure out what do we have.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s the dates around it. How much of it is still applicable today? So a percentage, I don&#8217;t know exactly what percent, but over half of it came over, but we did have a good percentage that we just did not pour it over because it may have been out of date. You know, we&#8217;ve had blog entries from, you know, 12 years ago, you know, those could go.</p>



<p>So we definitely didn&#8217;t have a very thorough content audit as we were bringing things over.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:13:50] Did that have, yeah. Did that have any negative SEO implications to your member?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:13:55] We, we did not because we were trying to make sure that we kept an SEO focus the [00:14:00] whole time we were designing and building the site.</p>



<p>And that was one of our main criteria, because as I said to the team, probably three times a week, I don&#8217;t want my SEO.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:14:09] Right.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:14:11] It was this a continue. That was always a message that I said continuously is that let&#8217;s make sure we&#8217;re looking at it from the right SEO perspective and that the team was able to do that.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:14:21] And then the other question I have, and this is maybe the biggest one is, I mean, you&#8217;ve got&nbsp; strongly opinionated, executive leadership team, the guy who built Drupal, included in that conversation. how did you deal with the challenges of, especially at Acquia where you&#8217;re surrounded by people that literally build websites for a living.</p>



<p>how did you handle the design by committee? My opinion, the highest paid person&#8217;s opinion problem. How did you fight that?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:14:48] Well, first of all, we developed like a steering committee internally and that steering committee had a couple of execs on it, the ones that would be most vocal. And so we would give periodic updates to the steering committee.</p>



<p>we [00:15:00] also make sure that we balance that by having external stakeholders. So, you know, so if someone has a personal opinion, you know, I don&#8217;t want that font to be that large. I don&#8217;t want that. I don&#8217;t think this is what our, you know, subheads should say. the best way I think, to always combat that is to say, well, we&#8217;ve tested it externally.</p>



<p>And here&#8217;s what our customers and partners are saying. And so I would always use that if there was any, if there was any type of a big, like design decision to make, I would test it externally, with a handful of people. And it was a good way for us to have a checks and balance. And then we just, you know, kept people updated and the times we would say, we&#8217;re moving on now.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve already decided on this design, because then what happens is people try to backtrack, right? And then you can&#8217;t move forward if you&#8217;re always backtracking. And so we had a very clear decision-making process. Here&#8217;s what it is. We&#8217;ve closed on this. We&#8217;re moving on now we&#8217;re onto this section and then we would try not to revisit and not to go back.</p>



<p>Occasionally we had to. but, but we would try hard not to. Did you ever&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:15:55] have a situation where regardless of what the data said, we&#8217;re not going to do [00:16:00] this.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:16:02] sure. Yeah. Yeah. I think it&#8217;s more, the other way around, which is, there were definitely a couple of times where, you know, the other execs would say, I want this and I&#8217;d say the data doesn&#8217;t support that.</p>



<p>And you know, if you hear five, six times, I want this, I want this. Eventually I&#8217;m going to give it to them because you just gotta, you know, you just gotta move on through the process, but you know, a little bit of a negotiation, I think too, So you&#8217;ve,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:16:28] you&#8217;ve heard good advice. Or if you want to get Lynn to do something, ask her five times and at a fifth time, she might decide to take you seriously.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll make sure to send that clip to the rest of the Acquia exec team for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;So my last question is on sales and marketing kickoff.&nbsp; you flew everyone in marketing out to this.</p>



<p>&nbsp;marketing and sales were partnered together in this annual kickoff. And it&#8217;s something that we just changed here. Recorded future because of you. So thank you. We are now going to call [00:17:00] ours revenue kickoff, and it was the same situation you probably used to face.</p>



<p>But talk to me about that change and what drove it and how you sold it internally in the organization. Cause I&#8217;m guessing it was a big investment. It was&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:17:12] a big investment. but one that I&#8217;m so, so happy that we did. and I&#8217;ve done this in my past as well, but you know, when I came back in, it was a couple of months before kickoff.</p>



<p>And the question was is, you know, can you name your three marketers that you&#8217;re going to send the kickoff? I&#8217;m like, what are you talking about? I&#8217;m only sending three people. Like what, how could that be? So that&#8217;s when I said, okay, next time we have kickoff. We are going to have a sales and marketing combined kickoff.</p>



<p>I put it in my budget in the beginning of the year. So right now I&#8217;m allocating a budget for next year and it&#8217;s included in there. Hopefully. I don&#8217;t know, maybe next year it won&#8217;t be virtual. Who knows. But, but, but, so I allocated out as part of my marketing budget to have the people come in from all around the world.</p>



<p>and then we made sure that, and I&#8217;m spending time now when our content to make sure that we have the right level of marketing content as well. And sales and [00:18:00] marketing is definitely. You know, synced up together. It&#8217;s really important because as marketers, you need it, you need to hear the same story that the sales folks are, are telling, right.</p>



<p>And you need to be part of that and we need, and I also want them to have that feeling of inclusion and enthusiasm and energy, and like part of a big thing, a kickoff is just pumping people up and why wouldn&#8217;t we want marketers to feel that same way, you know, and be pumped up in that same way. So it&#8217;s now it&#8217;s just given that I was like, Oh yeah, sales and marketing kickoff.</p>



<p>Everyone&#8217;s going. Yeah, we work on the content together, myself and the CRO. and it&#8217;s, you know, we do it hand in hand. Now there&#8217;s no questions about it. It&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:18:36] sucks. It sucks because it&#8217;s hard. whether it&#8217;s three people or four people or five people, there&#8217;s always the sixth who, you know, deserves to go, but you got to draw the line somewhere.</p>



<p>It was hard for us. Here virtual kickoff is easy.&nbsp; we have enough on our zoom meeting for as many people as we want, but I&#8217;m going to do what you did and fight for actual TNE to cover the entire marketing team, getting [00:19:00] together.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a six figure plus investment, obviously. I feel like&nbsp; it sends such a terrible message to the person who was number six or seven or 10 on that list. You&#8217;re not important enough to our revenue future that you&#8217;re going to stay home while everyone else is going out and networking and learning.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s just such a. In retrospect since it&#8217;s a terrible message,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:19:21] right? Yeah, totally agree. But now that you know, now that at least, you know, probably for the first half of the year, probably all kickoffs will be virtual. It&#8217;s a great opportunity to include for people to include all of marketing and make sure that there&#8217;s, you know, an agenda set that covers marketing topics as well.</p>



<p>You know? So it&#8217;s prime time for&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:19:36] everybody. So for marketing specific activities, was there a part of it, you carved out specific just for marketing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:19:45] Yeah. So we did a marketing department day, if you will, when we were in person and we&#8217;re doing the same thing actually virtually.</p>



<p>So the last day of kickoff is all of marketing together. and we would cover the marketing plan and marketing topics and then do a lot of, team-working sessions together and brainstorming. [00:20:00] And one of the things that I always had, and I&#8217;m doing it again this year is that day, that marketing department day is really for.</p>



<p>The junior members of the team to get up and present. It&#8217;s not, for me, it&#8217;s not for my direct reports, not for the managers, individual contributors that get up and they present and talk about what they do or they get to participate in a brainstorming session. But, I want to see that agenda, which is, you know, 90%, all the junior members of the&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:20:25] team.</p>



<p>Yeah, they hear from you enough. They don&#8217;t, they don&#8217;t need to hear from you again, let your kickoff,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:20:29] right,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:20:30] right. Great. For&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:20:31] them in terms of their own development and career development. And it gets them pumped, you know, really does.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:20:37] It&#8217;s a less scary environment than doing it in other place and other places in front of other people.</p>



<p>Right. It&#8217;s a good way to get practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:20:44] Yeah, exactly.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:20:46] I also like what did you call the dedicated weeks where There was no meetings. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:20:50] Oh, we called them. I think I might&#8217;ve missed named it, but I called it a marketing scrum week.</p>



<p>And so basically what we do is I give people permission one week, a quarter [00:21:00] to not go to meetings. And so I give them air cover in the company. I say, we&#8217;re in marketing scrum week. We are heads down. Everyone is working and no meetings. and that includes no zooms right now. And so we develop a list.</p>



<p>Everyone needs to put together a list of. What accomplishments they want to make during that time. And, and we track it on a nightly basis. We report back out how many tasks items were completed, how many more to go. We encourage members of the team to, you know, get going. You can do five more. and we just get an incredible amount of work done, throughout the week.</p>



<p>And, it&#8217;s great because it&#8217;s the one thing that people wanted, right? The one thing that people want is more time. How can you give you more time? And so this was one way to do it was to keep them out of meetings and to have heads down, working&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:21:41] time. How much of your day spent meetings? I always find that fascinating.</p>



<p>Are you, are you like, you have 10 30 minute meetings a day or.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:21:49] I have quite a few. Yeah. I do have a lot. And then I ended up, you know, I ended up catching up at night. There&#8217;s no question. but I do try to block out those times when I really need [00:22:00] thinking time and working time. Like I&#8217;ve been blocking out time now to work on my 2021 plan.</p>



<p>and I make sure that I carve out enough time to spend enough focus&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:22:08] during the week. Like literally block your calendar off. So no one can bother you time.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:22:11] Yes. Yes. Yep. Yeah, I have to, otherwise I can&#8217;t, I need that concentrated period of time to really, you know, put pen to paper and really, you know, have the time to work on it.</p>



<p>So, but there&#8217;s a, there&#8217;s a lot of other meetings in between. No question.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:22:28] Well, the next thing I&#8217;ll steal from you is going to be scrum week. If I come up with a better name for it, I will let you know, but I probably will just keep the name and your honor, and we&#8217;ll cause it was such a great idea</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:22:39] right. I love it. It really is a, I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s I think it&#8217;s one of the best, best gifts I&#8217;ve been given to the team, you know? Cause they really, they really value it a lot. And people will say when scrum week, when is it?</p>



<p>When is it? You know? So I know that&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:22:51] people took it seriously. Like no meetings, like it was not like a nice, it was, you would not book a meeting with anyone on your team during that period. And people understood why and [00:23:00] you&#8217;d communicate the results after the week. And it was clear that a bunch of work got done.</p>



<p>When&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:23:05] we were in the, when we were in the office, I used to walk around to make sure there wasn&#8217;t any violations going on. It became a kid, became a joke, you know, but if two people were sitting in a conference room together, I&#8217;d come in and this isn&#8217;t a meeting, is it? And&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:23:17] here&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:23:17] it came a joke. So&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:23:19] that&#8217;s hilarious.</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:23:20] It was awesome. I can&#8217;t do that&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:23:21] virtually. Yeah. I learned a lot from you just in that time they had Acquia, you&nbsp; embodied a lot of what it takes to be CMO of a really big company and a lot of those types of lessons&nbsp; I&#8217;m trying to apply here.</p>



<p>So I&#8217;ll definitely apply the scrum lesson here as well. But I do want to thank you for yeah. For helping me out.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:23:39] Thank you. And I&#8217;ve learned a lot from you as well. So we miss having you on stage.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:23:44] You miss&nbsp; my speaking, it incredibly fast pace. That was my biggest contribution&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:23:50] and a hundred ideas.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:23:52] And a hundred ideas and one of them would be good. I still, I see the website still has my idea, like putting the picture of dress on it still. So that was apparently good [00:24:00] enough to have lasted for 12 months.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:24:01] That&#8217;s right. Exactly.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:24:03] So there you go. Well then thanks so much for your time today. Really enjoy this as always stay in touch and thank you.</p>



<p><strong>Lynne Capozzi: </strong>[00:24:09] Thank you, Tom. Yeah, you stay in touch as well. Happy holidays.</p>

<p>This week&#8217;s guest on Scaleup Marketing is my friend and former colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-iandiorio-514859/">Jess Iandiorio</a>, the CMO at Starburst Data. Jess and I worked together at Acquia, and she’s previously been at Endeca, Drift, and Mirakl.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jess and I talk about the <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/the-real-reason-women-arent-getting-ahead-in-tech-she-s-not-strategic-5ba98ad91f77">She’s Not Strategic</a> challenge that women face when trying to move up in an organization. And we get into the importance of category creation for companies who don’t fit into an existing box.</p>

<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:00:00] Hey Jess, how are you?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:00:01] I&#8217;m doing great.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:00:02] So good to see you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jess, your background.&nbsp; You have the Midas touch. you worked at Endeca. One of Boston&#8217;s best tech companies ever. Endeca is the closest thing we have to the PayPal mafia everyone who left Endeca has done something awesome.</p>



<p>Then you went to Acquia where of course you had the misfortunate working with me, another very successful company you went to drift for a little bit. You went to Mirakl who raised a ton of money. and now you&#8217;re at Starburst Data. You&#8217;ve had a pretty awesome run.</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:00:29] Thanks. Yeah. when I look back, I&#8217;m like, I have no idea how it all happened, but it&#8217;s been a pretty wild ride and I&#8217;ve been with some successful companies, so it&#8217;s been good. And, you were a big part of&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:00:38] that. Thank you. Tell us about Starburst Data. So what does Starburst data do ?</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:00:44] come up for an elevator pitch on the spot.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:00:46] Yes. This does put a lot of pressure on you.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:00:49] Yeah. So, Starburst is all about helping companies get faster access to all of their data so they can make better decisions. So we&#8217;re in the big data analytics world, where one piece of [00:01:00] technology that really helps.</p>



<p>People kind of move on from the idea of having all of their data in a single source of the truth. Kind of that that term people have used forever is basically synonymous with the enterprise data warehouse model. And it&#8217;s been painful. People can&#8217;t get all their data in one place. And so that creates teams that don&#8217;t have the right level of access in the right time to the data that they need.</p>



<p>And I think we solved that. I mean, we, we use this open source technology called Presto, which is all about accessing data anywhere. It was created at Facebook for companies of Facebook scale. and they really needed a better solution for faster and more accurate data access and analytics there. They open-sourced it in 2013.</p>



<p>and it&#8217;s been, you know, it&#8217;s been used by thousands of companies. Across the globe and the team that created Starburst actually first started working with Presto when they were at Teradata. and then they built sort of almost an MVP of what would become Starburst, more of a support service to help support commercial Presto users.</p>



<p>and then [00:02:00] they spun off into creating Starburst. And the cool part about that story is they started with customers and revenue. They were able to bring their support contracts into. Starburst. so it&#8217;s not often that you hear about a company that was created with customers, revenue and product market fit from day one, but that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s really part of this story.</p>



<p>And so very cool company. Awesome founding story. We&#8217;ve been very successful so far. and the future is bright based on the demand we&#8217;ve seen this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:02:26] marketing and open source is hard. This is your second time doing it.&nbsp; I think he might be a little bit crazy for going to do this.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s hard about marketing and open source.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:02:34] Yeah. So I did say after the time at Acquia came to an end that I would probably never work for another open source version again. And, you know, I&#8217;m super glad I&#8217;m back in it.</p>



<p>And I&#8217;ll talk more about that, but, but what makes it hard is when you are a technology marketer, your goal is to build a market grade demand and help. Fuel sales for the organization. And when you work for an open-source commercialization company, there&#8217;s this big [00:03:00] part of the offering that you have no control over, that&#8217;s free.</p>



<p>And you start to have unique challenges in your go to market strategy about when and how do you embrace free when and how do you steer away from it? How do you help sales through that? How you help the market and in particular analysts through that, and you run the risk of over rotating one way or another.</p>



<p>And I think it&#8217;s really difficult to find that balance of where you lean in to the open source value prop side. And when you lean into the commercial value side, and if I&#8217;m talking to sales, I don&#8217;t say boo, about open source and I&#8217;m talking to analysts or another constituent where it&#8217;s important. You have to have this agility and your messaging and basically your whole go to market, that, that really removes focus as the downside.</p>



<p>You know, on the upside, you have a lot of opportunities and levers to pull. but, but it is pretty complicated and there&#8217;s a lot that&#8217;s outside of your control. And I mean, I think back to Acquia, when you&#8217;re the leading commercial entity for an open source project, you bear the burden of raising the awareness of [00:04:00] that open source technology, which many other.</p>



<p>Companies stand to benefit from. And so you, you open the door, you create the market, you invest in analyst relations, like, you know, this intimately. And then it just creates this market for others to come in and benefit from. And, and that gets tough, especially when those competitors start hitting Gardener&#8217;s radar and they come into the evaluations and it&#8217;s like a sad circle of, you know, unfortunate circumstances, which are just ultimately required for creating the category, creating the visibility, the open project.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:04:29] So. Yeah. I think when we, obviously, we experienced a lot of those challenges, but it&#8217;s hard. when you have to market open source, how do you think about budget allocation? How do you think about resource allocation? Those are hard&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:04:43] questions. I think it&#8217;s fascinating. So, so as a result of the experience at Acquia and how, and how focused I got on budget management at miracle, my budget right now, I actually have every line item attached to what piece of the strategy does it influence?</p>



<p>And one of the pieces of the strategy is to [00:05:00] evangelize Presto. And so I can actually to the degree of, I think it&#8217;s around 10% of my budget. Is kind of roughly allowed to go towards just marketing open source. And then that helps me keep my eye sort of on the prize, so to speak and make sure that we&#8217;re focused on doing the right things that are going to develop our business.</p>



<p>but you know, depending on the quarter, that might be more like 20% if we&#8217;re heavy on community events, throughout the course of time. So, so I get to that super granular level of being able to track. You know, what level of web investment goes to opensource? What level of field marketing goes to open source?</p>



<p>what level of analyst investment goes to open source? Things like that?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:05:38] Yeah. I have no idea. I&#8217;m at the other side of that, we were pretty conservative marketing team at recorded future, but I struggle.&nbsp; getting visibility in the budget is still a huge challenge for me.</p>



<p>Yeah. But these days&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:05:51] you&#8217;re big time. So you have the, you have like more, that just means you have more experience and like you have less need to prove out what you&#8217;re [00:06:00] doing. And I&#8217;m earlier in my running out. All running all of marketing. And so that forces me to be super granular on budget management, you know, among other things.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:06:09] But talk about that. So you&#8217;ve, Mirakl was, was medium-size aqui was big and deco was pretty big.&nbsp; you were marketing hire number one, right?</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:06:17] It&#8217;s been again, wild ride. I came for the opportunity and that opportunity was, I felt like the market was massive. I felt like the technology was unique and differentiated. I had skills to bring into the open source commercialization dynamic. and I had sort of cut my teeth on running marketing overall at miracles.</p>



<p>So I felt like. This is the perfect opportunity. Read my wings on, on this new opportunity and really try to do it all from scratch. Whereas I had come in a little bit early, sorry. A little bit later when I joined miracle. so this was a series a, I was the first marketer hired and it&#8217;s funny, you know, when I look back, I entered and it was like darkness from marketing.</p>



<p>so the other piece about this story is Starburst was bootstrapped for the first two years. And [00:07:00] so because they had revenue and product market fit and customers. They were able to keep a lean team and not take on funding for a long time, almost a full two years. And so what that means is it&#8217;s a wonderful success story.</p>



<p>However, there was very minimal marketing investment. And so what you might have entered into at another company that was two years. Old, you might have seen a lot more maturity in the marketing function. You might&#8217;ve seen tech stack lead flow. You might&#8217;ve seen a messaging guide. You know, these things were all opportunities for me, but you know, ground zero real grounds ago.</p>



<p>and so the first challenge was how are we going to get people on the same page with how we communicate? And so that was where I lean into my product marketing skills, the stuff I love to do. And we got through a, sort of an initial iteration of how we position ourselves, built out sales materials. And then we went into the demand gen side, getting our infrastructure up and running, hiring the team, which has been fun.</p>



<p>we we&#8217;ve gone. I think we&#8217;re now at 12 people on the team and we should be wow. When you, by early next year,&nbsp;</p>



<p>[00:08:00] <strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:08:00] one to 12,&nbsp;</p>



<p>Who were your first three hires.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:08:03] So first hire was Mandy who runs events and she&#8217;s amazing. She came over from rapid seven and, and she started, and that was the person I interviewed. In person, but she started remote in March and, and it was the exact moment COVID hit and all of the events came out from under us.</p>



<p>So, so she&#8217;s done a phenomenal job transitioning to digital and picking up some aspects of ABM with tools like Sendo. So, cool. So that was my first hire. And then right on the heels was Eric who runs them. Yeah. Jen for us. And so to me, there, there was critical infrastructure on functions there first.</p>



<p>Followed a meal immediately by product marketing. You know, when, you know, we&#8217;d spend a lot of time working on that, but you certainly need great product marketers to have a better lock-in with sales. Then I&#8217;ve gone on to content marketing, web marketing and those functions. So actually now, and we even have marketing ops, which I&#8217;m excited.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:08:52] Wow.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:08:53] Now we&#8217;re really staffed functionally within individuals. And now we&#8217;ll just be scaling because we have a [00:09:00] enterprise. Sales model right now, which is very much talked down, but we are working on a product that will launch next year, which will require a bottoms up motion. So I&#8217;m kind of building the team to staff, both, both needs of the business.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:09:13] Nice. So one of the things about you too, that&#8217;s I find interesting is like I post a lot of low quality content all over the place frequently. You post content once a year, there you&#8217;re good for a Jess medium posts or maybe even actually once every other year, if I go back and look at the data, but when you post something it&#8217;s true evergreen awesome content.</p>



<p>And I think your most is this your most recent, I assume your most recent it&#8217;s from August. The real reason women aren&#8217;t getting ahead in tech. She&#8217;s not strategic. So before I talk to this, I want to tell a little story. there&#8217;s a few things about you. I remember vividly you were an awesome negotiator, which is hard for people</p>



<p>when we would talk about when you&#8217;re&nbsp; promotion to be a VP of product marketing, you did what I would encourage everyone to do, [00:10:00] which is you knew what your worth to the organization and you fought for what you deserved. , but another thing you fought for which I was like, why would she want to do this?</p>



<p>You fought really hard to get into that weekly leadership meeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:10:13] Yeah,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:10:14] you fought hard to be in it. And I think it&#8217;s a little bit of this. She&#8217;s not strategic concepts , tell me a little bit about that post and&nbsp; what you&#8217;re trying to get across.</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:10:22] I&#8217;ve done like four or five speaking engagements since then on that topic. And I had&nbsp; no idea that people were going to respond to it the way they have. And what I wanted to do was share my opinion, which I had formed over the last, I&#8217;d say six or seven years in, in leadership of.</p>



<p>When I was in my childbearing years, I thought it was that I thought it was having kids and building families. And that was what was holding women back. And as I came to the other side of that, thank God, I will not be having any more kids, but I had this different perspective and I, everything started to shift.</p>



<p>And I started looking at the women around me, who I felt were very capable of who were consistently not getting to the next level. [00:11:00] And I listened a little bit more to the things that were said in their performance reviews, or just generally about them. And. And I just really had a strong opinion that there was this larger force going on.</p>



<p>That was really about a subconscious bias. not tending to view women as strategic. And so it just was happening repeatedly that someone would be up for a promotion and they wouldn&#8217;t get it. And this thing not strategic, you know, this sort of like, I call it it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s more like an illness. She&#8217;s not strategic.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ve been diagnosed, you know, women feel it. but there wasn&#8217;t a term for it. And this is what I&#8217;ve learned in all of the outreach iPads. Is that hundreds of people and I, and dozens of men actually have reached out to me saying, I felt like you were talking to me about my career and it&#8217;s been a bittersweet moment because I&#8217;m glad that this was impactful and it&#8217;s caused a lot of conversations.</p>



<p>but I&#8217;m a little bit sad that it actually resonated so much to the point that that many people would tell me that they felt that I was talking to them and that it cut to the quick for so [00:12:00] many people. And I think. What I tried to do was make it a positive, you know, that you don&#8217;t have to be stuck here.</p>



<p>And there are things that you can do to work on your perception, to come through it. And I also wanted executives leaders who are pulling this and maybe not even realize it yet. You know, diagnosing people with not strategic and you know, many women in particular. I wanted them to check themselves.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s even come out of my mouth. And I like to think I meant it, but I have to go back and like revisit why I said that and check myself as well. so I, I thought it was important to write. I got the support of Justin, our CEO, who was awesome. He actually. Went through it line by line, asked me questions, made some really good points, and helped me help me Polish it up.</p>



<p>so that was why I wrote it was just because I had something to say, since publishing it, I&#8217;d say I felt like a bit of a pressure. To keep it up. and like you said, back to your initial point, I generally like to write something every couple of years. So it&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s pushing me to be on a [00:13:00] hotter cadence here.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:13:01] don&#8217;t let it diminish the quality of the content you create. I guess that&#8217;s the cause you might go slow, but everything you produce is fantastic.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:13:10] The sequel is actually I&#8217;m working on it paragraph by paragraph. So&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:13:17] the problem is a lot of the, the women in particular who get called.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s not strategic they&#8217;re often the ones who execute the most and there&#8217;s this sort of balance.&nbsp; it&#8217;s hard to be strategic when you&#8217;re the person who&#8217;s out there working 55, 60 hours a week, churning through the non strategic things that you have to get done. how can I be strategic when I&#8217;m just buried in the work?&nbsp; how do you reconcile that? Yeah.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:13:42] well, you know, kind of to your point on when I advocated for promotion, you have to be willing to say no is one of my strong opinions here. And I think that that&#8217;s the hardest thing for women to do is, is somebody asks them to do something, you know, we want to prove were good contributors, good team players.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re going to do it. Even if it taxes us incredibly. [00:14:00] So I had to learn to say, no, I had to learn to stop volunteering for everything. And even though people were relying on me as a person who got things done, I had to stop doing everything and stop throwing my, my hat in the ring for whatever project or problem was on, on the horizon.</p>



<p>And, and that particular, you know, and I I&#8217;ve talked about that to other people. There&#8217;s, there&#8217;s been two big inflection points in my career and I&#8217;ve had to be really strong with either saying no or demanding what I needed in order for that to happen. And that&#8217;s a big challenge for a lot of women. I mean, I, I am pretty assertive, but those have been challenging moments for me too.</p>



<p>So for women who are not necessarily as assertive, you can imagine it is, it is an obstacle that seems impossible to over overcome. So yeah, I do think you have to find a way to advocate for yourself. Find a way to build champions that are above you. And that may be your manager and that may not be your manager.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s one of those big challenges where if you put all your eggs in your manager basket, and that person is not going to be helpful to you, then, then you don&#8217;t really have any [00:15:00] other conduits, to moving. So, so it&#8217;s important. It&#8217;s really important to build relationships champions, and, and be willing to advocate for yourself.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:15:09] You offer in this post, you offer a bunch of advice&nbsp; like upleveling, your presentations. you, and I&#8217;ve been in tons of QPRs together. And you just go until we did this campaign and this , like let&#8217;s slow down, let&#8217;s take a step back&nbsp; when you have executives in the room, let&#8217;s just take one step back.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:15:24] Yeah, we did. We actually just came through the QBR two weeks ago and it&#8217;s the second one we&#8217;ve had at Starburst. And, and just like you&#8217;re saying, we&#8217;ve got, I&#8217;ve got hardworking team. I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m super proud of what everybody is doing with the time that we&#8217;ve been able to pull this together.</p>



<p>And everybody&#8217;s eager to share what they&#8217;ve worked on. And so there&#8217;s this natural tendency, like you said, to sort of want to boil the ocean and show activity volume and it&#8217;s happening, but it&#8217;s the opposite of what&#8217;s effective in that forum. So we worked really hard on what would a one-hour QVR look like and how could everybody participate?</p>



<p>You know, functionally as, as leaders of events and demand gen, [00:16:00] in that timeframe with other, with other stakeholders there. So we did not nail it. And the whole team, you know, we all agree and it&#8217;s a hard thing I&#8217;ve never seen like, Oh, this is a perfect QBR. Let&#8217;s just replay that. so it&#8217;s iterative, but, but we did work very hard on each section, had the wins and the losses and that that&#8217;s the takeaways and that&#8217;s where you want the conversation to happen.</p>



<p>Yeah,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:16:23] another point is making sure your strategic contributions are clear.&nbsp; The credit is given to three levels above where the work actually happened.&nbsp; how do people make sure that their contributions don&#8217;t get buried, especially,&nbsp; if there are four levels below the CEO or how do people elevate their contributions?</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:16:40] Now I find this to be a really tough topic because I advocate for subtleties here. And this is where a lot of women can get tripped up. If they go too overtly for credit, you know, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s an unfair judgment that comes against them for like, you know, trying to take too much credit. And so I, I find that.</p>



<p>Again, you want [00:17:00] champions, but you want to look back on something and talk to someone about, remember when we did this, I really thought that this was going to be great. It turned out it wasn&#8217;t great, but I was proud of that. You know, like I find that there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s ways to remind people that you were attached to an initiative, give them some information about what you thought could have been better, but then also land what you thought you did well and, and give a more comprehensive picture of the scenario, the other people involved and what you contributed.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s better than saying. I&#8217;m proud of doing this, but that doesn&#8217;t end very well with people. and that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s what might come across the wrong way. and, and so I think finding ways to think about how you&#8217;re going to clarify your contributions in the bigger picture with other people. Is is a better approach.</p>



<p>and also being introspective in that effort and saying something didn&#8217;t go right. And I think we should do that next time. You know, you&#8217;re showing that you thought about it, you learned you&#8217;re coming up with ideas for the next thing. And you&#8217;re continually reminding people you&#8217;re attached to that strategic ambition.</p>



<p>[00:18:00] <strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:17:59] And you also talk about. This one&#8217;s controversial for me to always participate in company sponsored activities. I do my best to go to bed every night by nine o&#8217;clock. I dread having to stay out late now. I used to like it 10 years ago.&nbsp; but it&#8217;s hard because as you say,&nbsp; you feel extra tax because you already have family commitments.</p>



<p>I hear you. Do it as much as you can. This one is hard, but I totally agree. it&#8217;s just a sacrifice that we have to get behind.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:18:29] Yeah, I think so. I agree with that. And I think it depends on if your aspiration is to be in leadership. You have to, you have to be ready to give those extras and it is a compromise, but it is important even if it seems superficial, you know, and it seems like there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m going to sit on a zoom and have a beer and talk shop with my coworkers.</p>



<p>Instead of sitting down with my kids and having pizza on Friday night, you know, Sometimes I, I joined the zoom with my kids with pizza and beer and, you know, I find ways to make it work. But the thing about the importance there is it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s just [00:19:00] visibility and that&#8217;s back to why I fought to being in the exact forum.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s those are really important forums for visibility and connections.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:19:06] What I found my, my hack there as you well know, is the sneaky exit. So, you know, show up a long enough to where you&#8217;re seen and, but get out early. And then they&#8217;re like, Oh Tom, no, actually I left four hours ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:19:22] Yeah. Now you&#8217;re not saying Irish goodbye.</p>



<p>Is that a taboo term now? Cause&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:19:26] I was thinking about it in my head before I brought it up. I don&#8217;t think it is, sneaky exit Irish, exit Irish goodbye. There&#8217;s a whole bunch of ways to describe this beautiful. Underappreciated technique of showing up, letting people see you, go in heavy, let people see you go out silent, like a Ninja.</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:19:44] Now I have a similar but different approach with that, which is like, I call it nothing good happens after midnight. Now this doesn&#8217;t apply to the, this COVID world cause we&#8217;re not hanging out, but I have never stayed out at any corporate engagement past midnight. I like to think that&#8217;s helped me [00:20:00] because I&#8217;ve avoided the underbelly of our world.</p>



<p>And, you know, maybe I missed some opportunities to have fun and like be part of stories, but, you know, I don&#8217;t really think so. And, yeah, I think you got it.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:20:11] Our sales at recorded future sales kickoff. I went and did like my dad&#8217;s speech to the whole field organization. Don&#8217;t do anything stupid. I&#8217;ve done all the things that you&#8217;re thinking about going to do.</p>



<p>And I felt terrible the next morning. Just go to bed at 10, like I&#8217;m going to do, I don&#8217;t think anyone listened to me.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:20:29] Did you tell them to ring the bell?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:20:30] So yeah. Told them ring the bell. So the Catholics on that ring, the bell story Belle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>don&#8217;t know how we went from a really great conversation on helping women become strategic to talking about Irish goodbye.</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:20:42] Well, it&#8217;s natural.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:20:43] It&#8217;s natural. All right. I will link up as they say, in the podcasting world, I will link up this article looking forward to the next version. You might have to sit on it for a few months. Gets too close to the August version. Yeah. To create some distance.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:20:57] Yep, absolutely. And that&#8217;ll take me another three [00:21:00] months to write in any way.</p>



<p>So&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:21:00] yeah. That&#8217;s the last thing I want to talk to you about is category creation. You and I have both strong thoughts on that. I&#8217;m going through a little bit of a similar dialogue at recorded future. Our challenge was we are, we invented a category called threat intelligence but it&#8217;s a little it&#8217;s limiting to us because the intelligence that our platform creates can be used. To help you prioritize patching. It can be used to help you figure out which vendors have risky technology in their stack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>our intelligence helps you look at&nbsp; your Splunk log data and you have millions of IP addresses and domains and file hashes, which ones should be paying attention to. So we&#8217;ve been in this journey of creating a category called security intelligence</p>



<p>&nbsp;I want to get your take on the idea of category creation, because I&#8217;ve been in this middle of this project right now. And one of the things I&#8217;ve learned was no one even cares about category labels anymore was a piece of feedback I got early this week. So what&#8217;s your take on category creation? Is that something you&#8217;re doing?</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:21:59] I have a [00:22:00] million strong opinions on this. I think it&#8217;s a misnomer for a lot of people. A lot of people don&#8217;t really think about category creation the right way to think about it. you just name it something, and it&#8217;s going to become a market to reap the benefits of it. And you&#8217;re going to be the leaders and blah, blah, blah.</p>



<p>And, and, or they think it&#8217;s just a marketing activity, marketing, over there doing arts and crafts, trying to do something. And it&#8217;s with the analyst and we don&#8217;t really care. there&#8217;s a lot of misperceptions around what it means to create a category. I think it&#8217;s a full on art and I feel like I&#8217;ve dedicated my career to it.</p>



<p>And I feel like a lot of people. Don&#8217;t really understand or appreciate what it means. so for me, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s examples. Like I&#8217;ll give an example at Endeca. Cause I felt like this was my first attempt at it. So Endeca their technology was well-known for website search. That was the core. Use case e-commerce was the core use case beyond that.</p>



<p>And we started realizing that the technology was being used to pull together, you know, using internal search mechanisms to bring in BI [00:23:00] data. It took us a little while to study what was going on and we had huge clients, you know, Toyota, Apple. A lot of auto manufacturers, GM. And we started to realize they were really using us for BI use cases.</p>



<p>And we started to try and figure out why, because that was not the core use case for the technology initially. And it realized, we realized that that was the Dawn of unstructured data and all this data was becoming available in written format, blogs, you know, comments. Reviews and ratings. So people were looking for ways to marry their existing structured data with this new unstructured content.</p>



<p>And our search engine was, was pretty perfect for that. And so we realized we were onto something new and big with, with an existing market that was large, and it was completely different than the initial use case. And so what we decided to do was we started with conducting some market research because we felt like we had a new take on BI, but we kind of needed to catalyze what that was.</p>



<p>So we worked with Forrester, they produced a report on agile [00:24:00] business intelligence, and this was the, the actual category we created. From that point in time to several months later, we continued that effort with doing an ROI report on what agile business intelligence was, meaning in terms of impact to business and what were they able to do?</p>



<p>What were the financial rewards of that? And then fast forward another few months after that, and we had. Apple and Ford onstage at the customer event, talking about their agile BI implementation with Endeca. Now I&#8217;ve never seen anything happen that quickly before, but it was, it was this lightning rod moment in that particular market where the old way of doing things was not able to handle what the new needs were.</p>



<p>We were able to meet those. We named the baby with an analyst firm, and then we were able to quickly establish ourselves as a leader. And then the story pretty quickly ends after that with the acquisition by Oracle, which I think it was part of. And so that&#8217;s the most condensed version, but. But that same story played out at Acquia where you, you work on understanding what is your disruption in the market?</p>



<p>How are you bringing something unique? And why do [00:25:00] you not fit into the existing categories? You condition the analyst to understand that you work with them to name the baby. And then you start the real work, which is conditioning the market to adopt that term. And then you can reap the benefits of it as that demand grows.</p>



<p>And you could miss it could be wrong, but. But, you know, neither here nor there, it&#8217;s a very concerted all company effort to pursue telling the world you do something unique and different and better, and it doesn&#8217;t fit in the existing boxes. Everybody else is looking for their answers. so I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m really invested in it as an art and science and as a longterm kind of way to build.</p>



<p>A company&#8217;s opportunity and there&#8217;s a great book. Play bigger. Have you read them?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:25:41] Yeah,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:25:43] I went to their conference last year and that&#8217;s a wild story by itself, but, I do believe in the discipline and I think that the, the ability to create the market and own it and become the King category King of that market is really what I think was.</p>



<p>Was part of Endeca success. It certainly was part of Acquia [00:26:00] success and it played itself out at miracle as well, because there was no existing market for marketplace platforms. You know, for companies who would help retailers, manufacturers, distributors stand up their own loan, their own online marketplace, all on Amazon.</p>



<p>You know, the world just sort of understood Amazon was a marketplace, but nobody understood. There was an enabling technology that could help them create. Not become Amazon, but, but use the, the benefits of the model Amazon was using to their own benefit, you know? And so, so we had to work with Gartner to create that category.</p>



<p>And, you know, here they are valued at $1.5 billion now.&nbsp; I could talk for days about it. It&#8217;s so important when you don&#8217;t fit in a box. However, if you have a box. Just be the goddamn best at that box. And don&#8217;t, you know,&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:26:47] I&#8217;m going to pull that out as my pull quote. There you go.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:26:49] that&#8217;s my long winded response to your question about what you&#8217;re working on.</p>



<p>Is there a box that you fit in and if so, be in the upper right [00:27:00] categories in a box&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:27:01] yet? I&#8217;m in the broad, broadly in the enterprise security market. Which is pretty crowded market, obviously with some big vendors, we are trying to carve out our story is bigger&nbsp; than the way they look at vendors.</p>



<p>We play in lots of different areas. I had a conversation earlier this week with, a consultant we&#8217;re working with on a positioning project or recorded future. And I have a lot of respect for, for this gentleman and he gave me some sort of anti category creation feedback.</p>



<p>Category creation is more important to the, and I&#8217;m reading from my notes here. Cause it&#8217;s actually what I wrote down is more important to the vendor than the customer. At this point, customers, aren&#8217;t interested in labels. They&#8217;re interested in the problems that you solve, which I think is, is fair.</p>



<p>analysts don&#8217;t even drive categories anymore. But he had the strong belief that, that trying to convince analysts that categories exist is a colossal waste of time.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:27:53] You just send that person my way. I really love to have a conversation with them&nbsp; I&#8217;m seeing in my current role at Starburst, as we just begin these [00:28:00] efforts, I&#8217;m already seeing dividends from the work we&#8217;ve done with Gartner, because they&#8217;re about to publish a market guide in the next couple of weeks for our space.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t love what they named the baby, to be honest, but we&#8217;ve already had inbounds for the terms they&#8217;re using, which I don&#8217;t like. And it actually is attributed because they brought gardener up in their process with us. And so, you know, is it everything? Is it, is it the only thing you do know? but I do think it can be fundamentally critical to how you build the perception of what you do and your value to the market.</p>



<p>and if you do the right stuff with Gartner or Forrester or both, it should yield inbound for you on those terms. And so you lean into it and you use their language, even though you don&#8217;t like it because it&#8217;s, they&#8217;ve created a stream to swim in. And when you don&#8217;t fit in a box that they already have, like just the same that you mentioned, we don&#8217;t fit tightly in data integration, data virtualization, or data housing.</p>



<p>We smell a lot like those options. And we do struggle with our initial meetings to clarify. [00:29:00] What we are and what we aren&#8217;t, and that&#8217;s all the stuff that points towards category creation. You know, you don&#8217;t cleanly fit in a box. You&#8217;re not going to win head to head and RFP. and you have to create a new space for yourself.</p>



<p>Ideally you do that with analysts because like it or not, Gartner still has a lot of cloud. They hold, they hold very good relationships with most of the fortune 500 organizations with the buyers. And, you know, you might view it as a necessary evil. I kinda like it, but it, it is what it is. it&#8217;s important.</p>



<p>And the category creation thing is real&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:29:30] strange for us. There&#8217;s not a magic quadrant in our there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a Forrester wave. That&#8217;s directly in one of our six primary use cases&nbsp; there is no Gartner magic quadrant we hope there will be, cause this market sort of eed ones, but you&#8217;re right.</p>



<p>Gardner in some ways can legitimize a category. I think, I think the point from this gentleman was that it&#8217;s really hard to do it and obviously you&#8217;re good at it. I think for a lot of companies though, you can go down. The analyst&#8217;s rat hole and put all this time and effort into inquiries and briefings and [00:30:00] feel like you&#8217;re doing a great job.</p>



<p>And then all of a sudden nothing happens.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:30:03] Yeah. I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;ll tell you what, how I utilize Gartner is just the core membership influence, influence, influence through inquiry. And then we buy their content because that&#8217;s a great top of the funnel asset to bring people into. You&#8217;ve done this before the portal programs are awesome for dimming.</p>



<p>And so when I go bigger with Gartner, It&#8217;s not to pay a hundred thousand dollars for an advisory day or a speaking engagement. I think that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s a waste of money for small companies, at least. but you know, you can get so much out of their standard relationship, the core membership, and if you use inquiry, right, it&#8217;s a tremendous vehicle.</p>



<p>for all of this work, it doesn&#8217;t need additive dollars.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:30:39] Yeah. Advisory days can be awesome when your main analyst lives in Munich and you get to go fly out.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:30:44] That would come up.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:30:46] I have many favorite pictures of us at these massive pretzels and the big old Munich, a mug of beer.</p>



<p>Yeah, of course. The best part of that is when I wrote in the whiteboard, that was the wall. Which of course you remember&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:30:57] that? I remember that. [00:31:00] it wouldn&#8217;t be the same. Maybe&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:31:01] Tom it&#8217;s it&#8217;s it&#8217;s not all. Well, this is not a whiteboard was basically the&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:31:05] layers into whatever you were doing on the whiteboard.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:31:09] Think advisory days back to garner again, like we did advisory days incredibly well, because we realized that part of the, you know, the part of the benefit of advisory days. Realizing that we&#8217;re all human sitting across from each other. And that, yes, the analyst has to write the report that can influence millions of dollars of, of business, but they&#8217;re still people.</p>



<p>And they&#8217;re just sick of being be asked by vendors. I think it&#8217;s helpful for people who do analyst relations to remember 99% of what people present is just nonsense. And these analysts know it, just talk to them like humans and things work out better&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:31:42] customers at them. You have to, you have to groom the, I mean, that&#8217;s a huge part of the category.</p>



<p>Strategy is customer marketing and proof points and putting those in front of the analyst as well. So like at a certain point in time, they don&#8217;t want to hear it from you anymore. You know? They they&#8217;ll put up with your quarterly briefing, but, you know, getting customers involved, helping them with their research, helping them [00:32:00] with, with what they have to accomplish, which is publishing reports, that showcase case studies, that that really helps.</p>



<p>yeah.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:32:06] Fantastic. Thank you so much for joining me today. Any final words for our audience? Any other, anything we didn&#8217;t cover that we should?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:32:16] no. I mean, I just was mulling over this category creation thing, and I think that. The, the reason it gets a bad name is that companies. Do a superficial exercise or they go down the path of doing one when it&#8217;s not necessary.</p>



<p>And I think that when there is a stream to swim in, you have to, you have to be great in that stream. And that should be your effort. It shouldn&#8217;t be about trying to convince people there&#8217;s something different and unique. when I was at the play bigger conference, Jennifer Johnson, I can&#8217;t remember where she was.</p>



<p>She was the CMO of tenable, I think. And I can&#8217;t remember the exact description of the category, but she was going through her challenge and they were trying to create a new category in the market, just wasn&#8217;t having it. And so, so they retrenched and they decided to be, you know, they, she got some advice from the guys who wrote the book.</p>



<p>[00:33:00] And they said, well, don&#8217;t create a new category. If the market doesn&#8217;t need a new category, that&#8217;s silly. You know, if, if, if this category is the one that everybody wants to use, then you&#8217;re going to serve up like the fattest fried chicken sandwich of that category. You&#8217;re going to be, you&#8217;re gonna put that magic quadrant on your homepage and that&#8217;s what they did.</p>



<p>And I think that when I look at my job now, I actually started hoping that we wouldn&#8217;t have to go down this path because it is so much work. You won&#8217;t understand it. But now that I&#8217;m a year in, I look back at, you know, how much we have to work to get things clear up front. I look at the markets that we touch, but aren&#8217;t in.</p>



<p>and I see that we need a different vehicle to communicate who we are and how we&#8217;re different. and it is an opportunity. So great news. Brand new way to approach data management and analytics that allows you to efficiently get access to data anywhere. And it&#8217;s very different from the old way, which was data warehousing, single source of truth, new way, single point of access to data anywhere.</p>



<p>And this is a fundamental part of that play. Bigger [00:34:00] book is the Frodo, the from two, So I love this work. I think it is real. I think it is fundamental to companies that need it just don&#8217;t do it if you don&#8217;t, because it&#8217;s way too hard. It&#8217;s way too expensive. It takes too long and people won&#8217;t understand it.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:34:13] Do you want to disclose, do you have any sort of financial relationship with play bigger? Do you have any, are you getting&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:34:17] paid? no, but we did actually evaluate bringing them on as advisors at miracle and their model is interesting. It&#8217;s equity based. interesting. Wow. Yeah. And, and we did not choose to go down that path, but I did go to the conference.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve got the lightning strike book right here and I have, I&#8217;m, you know, I&#8217;m a disciple. I think it&#8217;s, you know, it can be overdone. People can misunderstand it and it can be a buzzword or it can be real. And I think they&#8217;ve got a great framework.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:34:41] I think that the real part is, like you said, I mean, you are clearly inventing a category.</p>



<p>Where there are a billion, different legacy ways of, of dealing with data and you are, you&#8217;ve brought a new way. A lot of people use category creation as a positioning exercise, but they&#8217;re not doing something different. So they&#8217;re just ultimately creating confusion in the market. I think that is the [00:35:00] challenge.</p>



<p>And for us, we are, there is not, there are not other vendors who do what we do with intelligence. I think it does make sense. But I&#8217;ve seen category creation go poorly too.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:35:10] Yeah. Final question for you. Do you believe that the company is looking at this exercise as a overall company strategy? Or do you believe it&#8217;s being looked at as a positioning exercise?</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:35:21] it&#8217;s positioning that will set us up for the next 10 years of the company.&nbsp; It is being driven by the CEO. And it&#8217;s on a marketing, you know, we are heavily involved, but it&#8217;s not a marketing thing because there&#8217;s product implications. There are customer success implications.</p>



<p>So I think it&#8217;s part is it lets us figure out what we&#8217;re gonna say no to in the future.&nbsp; this is actually a fun exercise to go through.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:35:42] Yeah, I love it too. And I think the right thing is that the CEO has to drive it. The CEO has to be in charge of this exercise and whatever you develop for your positioning.</p>



<p>The CEO has to give that tip that pitch for the next two to three years. So they better love it and champion it and make sure the organization oriented&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:35:59] and</p>



<p>&nbsp;well, thank you so [00:36:00] much for joining me. I really appreciate it. I&#8217;m looking forward to your next post.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:36:04] All right. Several months from now&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:36:06] in 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Jess Iandiorio: </strong>[00:36:07] Perfect.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Wentworth: </strong>[00:36:08] Thanks Jess.</p>
